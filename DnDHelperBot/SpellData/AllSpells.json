    "Description": "By means of this spell, the caster is able to show any animal of animal intelligence to semi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that he desires friendship. If the animal does not roll a successful saving throw vs. spell immediately when the spell is begun, it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The spell functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster has ulterior motives, the animal always senses them (for example, the caster intends to eat the animal, send it ahead to set off traps, etc.). The caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet (i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one week, and all must be done within three months of acquiring the creature. During the three-month period, the animal will not harm the caster, but if the creature is left alone for more than a week, it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly. The caster can use this spell to attract up to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience level he possesses. This is also the maximum total Hit Dice of the animals that can be attracted and trained at one time: no more than twice the caster's experience level. Only unaligned animals can be attracted, befriended, and trained. The material components of this spell are the caster's holy symbol and a piece of food liked by the animal."

    "Description": "Upon uttering the bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures and any saving throw rolls they make against fear effects by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing, however, affects only those not already engaged in melee combat. The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). A second use of this spell is to bless a single item (for example, a crossbow bolt for use against a rakshasa). The weight of the item is limited to one pound per caster level and the effect lasts until the item is used or the spell duration ends. Multiple bless spells are not cumulative. In addition to the verbal and somatic gesture components, the bless spell requires holy water. This spell can be reversed by the priest to a curse spell that, when cast upon enemy creatures, lowers their morale and attack rolls by -1. The curse requires the sprinkling of unholy water."

    "Description": "Using this spell, three to five priests combine their abilities so that one of them casts spells and turns undead at an enhanced level. The highest-level priest (or one of them, if two or more are tied for highest) stands alone, while the others join hands in a surrounding circle. The central priest casts the combine spell. He temporarily gains one level for each priest in the circle, up to a maximum gain of four levels. The level increase affects turning undead and spell details that vary with the caster's level. Note that the central priest gains no additional spells and that the group is limited to his currently memorized spells. The encircling priests must concentrate on maintaining the combine effect. They lose all Armor Class bonuses for shield and Dexterity. If any of them has his concentration broken, the combine spell ends immediately. If the combine spell is broken while the central priest is in the act of casting a spell, that spell is ruined just as if the caster were disturbed. Spells cast in combination have the full enhanced effect, even if the combine is broken before the duration of the enhanced spell ends. Note that the combination is not broken if only the central caster is disturbed."

A command to \"Die!\" causes the creature to fall in a faint or cataleptic state for one round, but thereafter the creature revives and is alive and well. Typical commands are back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest, etc. No command affects a creature for more than one round; undead are not affected at all. Creatures with Intelligence of 13 (high) or more, or those with 6 or more Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. (Creatures with 13 or higher Intelligence and 6 Hit Dice/levels get only one saving throw!)"

The water is clean and drinkable (it is just like rain water). The created water can be dispelled within a round of its creation; otherwise, its magic fades, leaving normal water that can be used, spilled, evaporated, etc. The reverse of the spell, destroy water, obliterates without trace (no vapor, mist, fog, or steam) a like quantity of water. Water can be created or destroyed in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area as large as 27 cubic feet (1 cubic yard). Note that water can neither be created nor destroyed within a creature. For reference purposes, water weighs about 8 _ pounds per gallon, and a cubic foot of water weighs approximately 64 pounds. The create water spell requires at least a drop of water; the destroy water spell, at least a pinch of dust."

This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin. The reverse of the spell, cause light wounds, operates in the same manner, inflicting 1d8 points of damage. If a creature is avoiding this touch, an attack roll is needed to determine if the priest's hand strikes the opponent and causes such a wound.

Character alignment, however, is revealed only under unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, who do not stray from their faith, and who are of at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not. The degree of evil (dim, faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming) and possibly its general nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelming, the priest has a 10% chance per level of detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). The duration of a detect evil (or detect good) spell is one turn plus five rounds per level of the priest. Thus, a 1st-level priest can cast a spell with a 15-round duration, a 2nd-level priest can cast a spell with a 20-round duration, etc. The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide in the direction the priest is facing. The priest must concentrate--stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura--for at least one round to receive a reading. The spell requires the use of the priest's holy symbol as its material component, with the priest holding it before him."

Such hazards include simple pits, deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures (for example, trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant lions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed of natural materials (mantraps, missile trips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell is directional--the caster must face the desired direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap is laid in that direction. The caster experiences a feeling of danger from the direction of a detected hazard, which increases as the danger is approached. The caster learns the general nature of the danger (pit, snare, or deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor how to disarm it. Close examination, however, enables the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. The spell detects certain natural hazards--quicksand (snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such as a cavern that floods during rain, an unsafe construction, or a naturally poisonous plant, are not revealed. The spell does not detect magical traps (save those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the 2nd-level spell trip and the 3rd-level spell snare), nor those that are mechanically complex, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

The cancellation occurs regardless of the application and regardless of whether a heat or cold effect hits the character (for example, an endure cold spell is cancelled by magical heat or fire as well as by magical cold).

The number of subjects outlined depends upon the number of square feet the caster can affect.

Outlined objects or creatures are visible at 80 yards in the dark and 40 yards if the viewer is near a bright light source. Outlined creatures are easier to strike; thus, opponents gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls in darkness (including moonlit nights) and a +1 bonus in twilight or better. Note that outlining can render otherwise invisible creatures visible. However, it cannot outline noncorporeal, ethereal, or gaseous creatures. Nor does the light come anywhere close to sunlight. Therefore, it has no special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures. The faerie fire can be blue,green, or violet according to the word of the caster at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the object or creature thus outlined. The material component is a small piece of foxfire."

Objects in darkness beyond this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must have a line of sight or unobstructed path to that point when the spell is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. Light spells are not cumulative--multiple castings do not provide a brighter light. The spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions as the light spell, but with half the duration. Magical darkness is equal to that of an unlit interior room--pitch darkness. Any normal light source or magical light source of lesser intensity than full daylight does not function in magical darkness. A darkness spell cast directly against a light spell cancels both, and vice versa."

The spell lasts one round per level of experience of the caster, while the length of the path is 100 yards plus 20 yards per level of experience. (At the DM's option, some casters may be able to locate only those animals [or plants] associated closely with their own mythos.) While the exact chance of locating a specific type of animal or plant depends on the details and circumstances of the locale, the general frequency of the subject can be used as a guideline: common = 50%, uncommon = 30%, rare = 15%, and very rare = 5%.

The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus. Second, any attempt to exercise mental control over the protected creature (if, for example, it has been charmed by a vampire) or to invade and take over its mind (as by a ghost's magic jar attack) is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, nor end it, but it does prevent the vampire from exercising mental control through the barrier. Likewise, an outside life force is merely kept out, and would not be expelled if in place before the protection was cast. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creature to recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character. This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. To complete this spell, the priest uses holy water or burning incense. This spell can be reversed to become protection from good, with the second and third benefits remaining unchanged.

A successful saving throw against the reversed effect negates it, and any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Of course, cause fear can be automatically countered by remove fear and vice versa. Neither spell has any effect on undead of any sort."

    "Description": "When the priest casts a sanctuary spell, any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the protected creature must roll a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the saving throw is failed, the opponent loses track of and totally ignores the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. Note that this spell does not prevent the operation of area attacks (fireball, ice storm, etc.). While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to bless, perform an augury, chant, cast a light in the area (but not upon an opponent), and so on. The components of the spell include the priest's holy symbol and a small silver mirror."

While very few 1st-level priests find themselves in this situation, higher level characters often make use of this spell. Astral celerity doubles the character’s movement rate on the Astral Plane; normally, characters move at a rate of 30 times their Intelligence score in feet per round, but this spell increases this to 60 feet times their Intelligence score. As an incidental benefit, the caster also attunes himself to the plane much faster and suffers no penalties for missile fire while astral. While astral celerity is most often used in the astral plane, it also offers a small benefit to ethereal characters, too: their movement rates are increased by 50%, so a character with a movement rate of 12 would enjoy a movement rate of 18 while this spell was in effect. Of course, time and distance have little meaning in the overall scheme of the Astral or Ethereal Planes, but relative speed could be very important in avoiding an unpleasant encounter or escaping from pursuit of some kind."

    "Description": "By means of this spell, the priest can accurately estimate the chance of success of one specific action, such as climbing a dangerous cliff, making a trick bowshot, crossing a burning room unharmed, or even striking an enemy. The action in question must be one that would normally be resolved by a die roll, but the priest doesn’t have to be the person who attempts the feat; he can use calculate to estimate the odds for anyone taking an action in his sight. The priest has a 70% chance, +2% per level, of making an accurate estimate. If successful, the DM reveals to the player the action’s chance for success or any modifiers that may be in play. For example, he could reveal a particular opponent’s Armor Class or THAC0, the saving throw an opponent would require in order to save against a particular spell cast by the priest or the priest’s wizard companion, or a character’s chance to open doors, bend bars, or use a thief ability. The priest could even calculate his odds for actions that might be resolved by a die roll or DM caprice, such as his chance to avoid detection by hiding behind a rock. This spell takes into account factors that the priest himself may not be aware of, so from time to time a character may receive some very confusing results from this spell. For instance, if the priest doesn’t know that an orc chieftain is actually a polymorphed tanar’ri masquerading as an orc, he may be astonished to learn that the “orc” has a THAC0 of 7! If the priest fails his calculation check with a roll of 99 or 00, his calculation is wildly skewed in a random fashion. The material component for this spell is a miniature abacus of ivory worth at least 100 gp. It is not consumed in the casting of the spell."

The caster can affect any animals he wishes to within the spell’s range, but all the subjects must be of the same species. The subject creatures are not allowed a saving throw unless they have magical powers, abilities, or are clearly not entirely natural; a priest could calm a normal bear, war dog, or wolf with little trouble, but it’s more difficult to affect a winter wolf, hell hound, or owlbear. While under the influence of this spell, the affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee, unless they are attacked or confronted by a significant hazard such as a fire or a hungry predator. Once roused, the spell’s magic is broken and the animals are free to act in whatever fashion they normally would.

The flame ceases to produce smoke and becomes much cooler; within 1 turn of the spell’s casting, the fire cools enough to be handled or touched barehanded without causing harm. The firelight is resistant to gusts of wind or poor burning conditions (pouring rain, lack of air, and so on), but complete immersion in water, vacuum, or magical darkness extinguishes the flame immediately. Firelight burns brighter and steadier than a normal flame, and a torch enchanted with this spell sheds light in a 30-foot radius instead of the normal 15-foot radius. The fuel source lasts throughout the duration of the spell. Unlike log of everburning, this spell is not at all useful for staying warm since firelight produces very little heat. Firelight inflicts 1d2 points of damage per caster level if cast on creatures of living or elemental fire, but has no other effect on these monsters. The material component is a mix of resins and incense, thrown into the flame to be affected."

    "Description": "The most humble of priestly spells is the orison, a brief prayer or invocation of a minor nature. Typically, priests learn a number of orisons as acolytes or students in order to hone their spellcasting skills and emphasize concepts, ideals, or phrases of particular importance to the faith. Because an orisons is not even on par with other 1st-level magic, a priest memorizes a number of individual orisons equal to three +1 per level (up to a maximum of nine) when he devotes a 1st-level spell slot to orison. In other words, a 1st-level priest can memorize four orisons for one 1st-level spell slot, a 2nd-level priest can memorize five, and so on. Unlike cantrip, an orison must have a specific effect, although the priest need not decide which incantation he will use until he actually casts the spell. Regardless of the prayer chosen, the orison’s duration is never more than one round per level. Known orisons include the following: Alleviate: A single creature suffering from nausea or pain is relieved of its discomfort. Magically induced nausea or pain is only alleviated if the victim passes a saving throw vs. spell with a –2 penalty. Calm: A single creature that has been startled or frightened is soothed. Victims suffering from magical fear may attempt a save vs. spell with a –2 penalty to calm themselves. Clarity: For the duration of the orison, the priest’s speech is clear and free of impediment—useful for readings from sacred texts and other such rites. Magical conditions such as confuse languages cannot be overcome by this orison. Courage: The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next attack roll, as long as the attack is made within the spell’s duration. Guidance: The priest gains a +1 bonus to a Wisdom or Intelligence check to determine the right course of action in a moral dilemma or puzzle. Healing: By his touch, the priest may heal a creature of 1 point of damage. Magic sense: If there is a persistent spell effect or magical item within 10 yards, the priest feels a recognizable tingle or sensation of some kind. He has no way to determine what item or spell may have caused the reaction. Memory: Any item the priest commits to memory during the spell duration is more completely and permanently learned; he gains a +2 bonus to any checks to recall the exact appearance, wording, or meaning of an item, text, or message. Resistance to magic: The caster gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw against magic of any type, as long as it occurs during the orison’s duration. Resistance to poison: The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw vs. poison, as long as it occurs during the orison’s duration. Other orisons of similar power or scope may be permitted by the DM. Generally, an orison should not affect more than one creature or die roll at a time, and an orison that can actually cause immediate harm to a creature should inflict no more than 1 or 2 points of damage. An offensive orison would be quite rare and most probably associated with an evil or chaotic priesthood."

However, protection from chaos does protect the recipient from creatures influenced by confusion and chaos spells and effects. The natural or bodily attacks of such creatures automatically fail, as long as the recipient does not use the spell’s power to trap, pin, or drive back the chaotic creatures in question.

The spell lasts for 3 rounds plus 1 round per caster level or until the subject loses contact with the earth.

The spell is most effective in areas or regions where a strong breeze is available, such as the heights of a mountain or the mast of a ship at sea. In areas of dead, calm air, it is much more difficult to muster the windpower necessary to arrest the caster’s fall. The caster’s rate of descent (and risk of damage) varies with the strength of the prevailing winds, as shown below. If the wind is very strong, the caster can even choose to gain altitude instead of falling, although he can rise no higher than 5 feet per level above his original height before the wind column loses cohesiveness and he starts to fall again. However, a priest could use this to leap out a castle window and allow the winds to bear him to the roof of the tower, if the conditions are right.

    "Description": "One creature, object, or 10' square Saving Throw: None This spell allows a priest to sense how far a character, creature, object, or area is from a condition of balance -- in other words, the degree to which its alignment is removed from true Neutral. The spell gives no indication of the \"direction\" in which the alignment is removed from true Neutral except under certain conditions which follow. The spell does, however, indicate along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies. For example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by one grade, and the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic Evil, the spell would indicate that it is removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Lawful Good. A priest has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the direction of variation along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest evaluating the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of learning that the creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is only one step away from balance). Similar to spells such as detect evil, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap. If cast on a creature with an intelligence level of \"animal\" or \"non-,\" it will always read true Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance). The material components are four iron coins which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The coins are not consumed in the casting."

    "Description": "This spell alters the appearance of words written in ink. When the spell is cast upon a written page, the ink imperceptibly begins to move. Over the next few days, the message becomes progressively more illegible. If the page is left undisturbed for six days, an entirely new message forms on the page. The new message is completely legible and is recognizable as the handwriting of the original author, but is contrary in content to the original message. After the spell is cast, the message will appear different every day. The DM decides the message that the page will carry after the sixth day has passed. Following is a sample of the changes that could take place in a message. Day One: The words of the letter appear faint, as if the author of the letter was running out of ink as he wrote. Day Two: The words have moved slightly from their original positions, as if the person writing the letter were shaking or in a moving carriage when the letter was written. Days Three and Four: The message is gibberish. Although the ink forms groups of letters arranged in lines with punctuation, nearly all the words are meaningless. This may appear to be some sort of code, but it means nothing. Day Five: The ink has formed real words. However, the sentence construction is still meaningless (e.g., Egg west worse green!). Day Six (and beyond): The message is coherent, but the opposite intent of the original message has been created. If the original letter read, \"Send troops quickly,\" the new letter reads, \"All is fine. Keep your men in reserve.\" If mistaken missive is cast on the pages of a spellbook or a scroll, the ink on the page reforms into a new spell of the same level as the original spell. Thus, a darkness spell might become a maze spell. However, the spell formula will be wrong. Although it will look like a proper spell, it will not function when cast. A coded message that is subjected to mistaken missive will appear as a coded message on the sixth day but will hold a different meaning than the original message. A glass of preserved words will allow the original message to be read correctly. Dispel magic will restore the message to its original form. The material component is three drops of ink."

To cast this spell, the priest must know the subject's real name (the name the subject was given as a child) or the date and place of the character's birth. The priest analyzes this information and is able to build a rough picture of the character's life history and personal specifics. The \"historical\" information discovered through this spell is generally vague. For example, the priest might learn that the subject was born in the woods and moved to the city only after hardship made his life untenable. Specific information is up to the DM. The DM might provide some or all of the following information. • The subject's character class or career The subject's approximate level (stated in terms such as \"novice,\" \"highly skilled,\" \"moderately competent,\" etc.) • The subject's standing in the community (\"highly respected,\" \"mistrusted,\" \"considered an enigma,\" etc.) • The subject's success or failure in his profession • The subject's prevailing character traits or mannerisms If the priest casts the spell based on an alias or incorrect birth information, the reading will be inaccurate. The DM should develop a history and personality at odds with the truth. This might allow the priest to determine whether the name of the subject is correct- -a reading giving information that conflicts with what the priest already knows should be a clue that the name is incorrect. The subject need not be present during the casting. The priest can cast the spell without ever having met the subject. The material component is a small book of numerological formulae and notes (different from the book used in telethaumaturgy). The book is not consumed in the casting. A DM may rule that this spell can be cast on humanoids or monstrous creatures. The information available will be similar (considering that words like \"profession\" will mean something different when applied to an ogre). This spell will categorically fail on creatures that have no concept of a personal name."

    "Description": "This is a cooperative magic spell. It requires a minimum of two priests and can accommodate a maximum of ten. Each priest must cast ring of hands on the same round. At the end of the casting, the priests involved join hands, thus completing the spell. If any priest breaks the circle, the spell immediately ceases. The priests may not move from their locations but are free to speak. They may not cast spells requiring a somatic or material component while the ring is formed. The ring of hands forms a protective barrier around the priests and everything within their circle. For each priest, assume a five-foot circumference of the circle; thus, three priests would create a circle of 15-foot circumference. For easy calculation, assume that for each priest, the circle can accommodate four persons. The barrier functions as a protection from evil spell. Attacks by evil creatures suffer a -1 penalty for every priest forming the circle. Saving throws made by the priests or anyone in the circle against attacks from such creatures receive a +1 bonus for every priest in the circle. Attempts at mental control over protected creatures are blocked. Extraplanar and conjured creatures are unable to touch the priests and those within the circle, although melee attacks against such creatures by those within the ring break the barrier. Because the priests casting the spell cannot move and must hold hands, they do not receive any Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class. Furthermore, opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against the priests, since there is little they can do to avoid a blow. Creatures within the ring are free to act as they wish. Melee attacks by those within the ring are limited to piercing weapons and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls since the priests intervene. The reverse of this spell, ring of woe, functions as detailed above except the effect applies to good creatures as would a protection from good spell."

    "Description": "One of the more bizarre contentions held by priests of the School of Thought is generally scoffed at by outsiders. The theory states that once a thought has occurred in someone's brain, it exists as a \"freestanding mental object.\" This \"thought object\" usually remains inside the brain of the creature that created it, but sometimes it escapes (this supposedly explains why people forget things). When this happens, the thought object stays in the geographical area where it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of the creature that initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into the invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that people can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought was lost. This supposedly works because the free-floating thought is recaptured, not because the locale reminds them of the thought. Unfortunately for philosophers who disagree with this, thought capture seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory. This spell makes the priest's brain something of a magnet that attracts thought objects in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions and can sometimes even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered some powerful emotion in the immediate vicinity. Thought objects are always attracted to the priest in the order of the strongest (those attached to powerful emotions or significant events) to the weakest. Thus, if several thought objects share the same vicinity, the priest will perceive information about the most interesting or significant event. The priest might pick up images of a battle from the point of view of a warrior who died there, or he might gain information about the victor of the battle. The DM dictates the information provided to the priest, and thus can use this spell to provide players with important background information or can add texture to a campaign world. The information provided might be highly cryptic or symbolic, perhaps in the form of a rhyme or riddle. The priest gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be cast a number of times in the same locale, with the priest gaining a different thought object with each casting. A locale contains a finite number of thoughts, however, and once the priest has gained all of them (per the DM), the spell will fail in that locale."

Once the ebony hand is cast, the magic of the touch- delivered spell is no longer conducted though physical contact with the caster's fingertips, but through the flickering aura of the ebony hand. The companion touch-delivered spell(s) may be cast either before or after the creation of the ebony hand, which does not expire with a single, successful touch and may be used to deliver multiple attacks if the spell duration permits. Note that the ebony hand does not enhance attacks with weapons or other ranged spells. The material component varies from religion to religion, but it is usually a piece of apparel or jewelry which is worn on the caster's hand to help focus the meditation (often a black glove or a simple silver or onyx ring). Regardless of the actual focus employed, the material component is not consumed by the spell and may be employed in multiple castings. As the spell description implies, the ebony hand may only be granted by malevolent deities to their evil priests."

The aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic. For example, a 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage (8-2 = 6), and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points, 5 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit points and all 5 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit points. Note that the operation of the spell is unaffected by permanent hit point losses due to energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss of a familiar, or the operation of certain artifacts; the temporary hit point gain is figured from the new, lower total.

For example, if a party is considering the destruction of a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury spell can be used to find if weal or woe will be the immediate result. If the spell is successful, the DM yields some indication of the probable outcome: \"weal,\" \"woe,\" or possibly a cryptic puzzle or rhyme. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1% foreach level of the priest casting the spell; for example, 71% at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc. Your DM determines any adjustments for the particular conditions of each augury. For example, if the question is \"Will we do well if we venture to the third level?\" and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 sp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (which the DM estimates the party could beat after a hard fight), the augury might be: \"Great risk brings great reward.\" If the troll is too strong for the party, the augury might be: \"Woe and destruction await!\" Likewise, a party casting several auguries about the same action in quick succession might receive identical answers, regardless of the dice rolls. The material component for an augury spell is a set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or similar tokens of at least 1,000 gp value (which are not expended in casting)."

    "Description": "This spell affects any single person or mammal it is cast upon. The creature then regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre is not. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the creature to hold back an onrushing red dragon for \"just a minute or two\" and if the charmed creature's view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of survival. The subject's attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the caster, but basic personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make itself defenseless, give up a valued item, or even use a charge from a valued item (especially against former associates or allies) might allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the caster. The victim's regard for the caster does not necessarily extend to the caster's friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the charmer's allies making suggestions such as, \"Ask him this question. . .,\" nor does the charmed creature put up with verbal or physical abuse from the charmer's associates, if this is out of character. Note also that the spell does not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. A successful saving throw breaks the spell. This saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's Intelligence, even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship. Intelligence Score Period Between Checks 3 or less 3 months 4-6 2 months 7-9 1 month 10-12 3 weeks 13-14 2 weeks15-16 1 week 17 3 days 18 2 days 19 or more 1 day If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm is broken automatically. If the subject of the charm person/charm mammal spell successfully rolls its saving throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated. This spell, if used in conjunction with the animal friendship spell, can keep the animal near the caster's home base, if the caster must leave for an extended period."

A caster who learns that a creature is being influenced has a 5% chance per level to determine the exact type of influence. Up to 10 different creatures can be checked before the spell wanes. If the creature is under more than one such effect, only the information that the charms exist is gained. The type (since there are conflicting emanations) is impossible to determine. The reverse of the spell, undetectable charm, completely masks all charms on a single creature for 24 hours."

    "Description": "This spell enables a priest to conjure up a weak air elemental--a dust devil of AC 4, 2 HD, MV 180 feet per round, one attack for 1d4 points of damage--which can be hit by normal weapons. The dust devil appears as a small whirlwind 1 foot in diameter at its base, 5 feet tall, and 3 to 4 feet across at the top. It moves as directed by the priest, but dissipates if it is ever separated from the caster by more than 30 yards. Its winds aresufficient to put out torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of nonmagical origin. The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a creature in gaseous form at bay or push it away from the caster (though it cannot damage or disperse such a cloud). If skimming along the ground in an area of loose dust, sand, or ash, the dust devil picks up those particles and disperses them in a 10-foot-diameter cloud centered on itself. The cloud obscures normal vision, and creatures caught within are blinded while inside and for one round after they emerge. A spellcaster caught in the dust devil or its cloud while casting must make a saving throw vs. spell to keep his concentration, or the spell is ruined. Any creature native to the Elemental Plane of Air--even another dust devil--can disperse a dust devil with a single hit."

Those of a race or religion unfriendly to the caster's have a +4 bonus to the roll. Any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Creatures with 4 or more levels or Hit Dice, or with a Wisdom of 16 or better, are unaffected. To cast the spell, the caster must speak without interruption for a full round. Thereafter, the enchantment lasts as long as the priest speaks, to a maximum of one hour. Those enthralled take no action while the priest speaks, and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the matter. Those entering the area of effect must also successfully save vs. spell or become enthralled. Those not enthralled are 50% likely every turn to hoot and jeer in unison. If there is excessive jeering, the rest are allowed a new saving throw. The speech ends (but the 1d3 round delay still applies) if the priest is successfully attacked or performs any action other than speaking. If the audience is attacked, the spell ends and the audience reacts immediately, rolling a reaction check with respect to the source of the interruption, at a penalty of -10. Note: When handling a large number of saving throws for similar creatures, the DM can assume an average to save time; for example, a crowd of 20 men with a base saving throw of 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men enthralled and five not."

    "Description": "When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps--concealed normally or magically--of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Note that this spell is directional, and the caster must face the desired direction in order to determine if a trap is laid in that particular direction. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the harmful or undesirable result was specifically intended as such by the creator. Thus, traps include alarms, glyphs, and similar spells or devices. The caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however, enable the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the caster's divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures (hence, a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are natural hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain, a wall weakened by age, a naturally poisonous plant, etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical wards (see the 3rd-level spell glyph of warding), this spell shows the form of the glyph or mark. The spell does not detect traps that have been disarmed or are otherwise inactive."

The spell is centered on a point selected by the spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed upon it. A knock spell cannot affect a fire trap in any way--as soon as the offending party opens the item, the trap discharges. As with most magical traps, a thief has only half his normal find traps score to detect a fire trap. Failure to remove it successfully detonates it immediately. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell will not detonate the spell. When the trap is discharged, there will be an explosion of 5-foot radius from the spell's center. All creatures within this area must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the caster, and half that total amount for creatures successfully saving. (Under water, this ward inflicts half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion. The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast (the method usually involves a key word). To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a stick of charcoal and touch the center of the effect. Attunement to another individual requires ahair or similar object from the individual. The material components are holly berries."

If the creature is protected from fire, the damage inflicted is reduced by 2 (i.e., 1d4+2 points). Fire dwellers and those using fire as an innate attack form suffer no damage from the spell. The flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, cloth, etc. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures (other than undead) struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it.

The reverse of the spell, badberry, causes 2d4 rotten berries to appear wholesome, but each actually delivers 1 point of poison damage (no saving throw) if ingested.

Elven chain mail is not affected, and magical metal armor receives an item saving throw vs. magical fire to avoid being heated. The material component is a holy symbol. On the first round of the spell, the metal merely becomes very warm and uncomfortable to touch (this is also the effect on the last melee round of the spell's duration). During the second and sixth (next to the last) rounds, heat causes blisters and damage; in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal becomes searing hot, causing damage to exposed flesh, as shown below: Metal Temperature Damage per Round very warm none hot 1d4 points searing* 2d4 points * On the final round of searing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer one of the following disabilities: hand or foot--becomes unusable for 2d4 days; body--becomes disabled for 1d4 days; head--fall unconscious for 1d4 turns. This effect can be completely removed by the 6th-level priest spell heal spell or by normal rest. Note also that materials such as wood, leather, or flammable cloth smolder and burn if exposed to searing hot metal. Such materials cause searing damage to exposed flesh on the next round. Fire resistance (spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat metal spell, as does immersion in water or snow, or exposure to a cold or ice storm spell. This version of the spell does not function under water. For every two experience levels of the caster, the metal of one man-sized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and armor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50 pounds of weight). Thus, a 3rd-level caster would affect one such creature, a 4th- or 5th-level caster two, etc. The reverse of the spell, chill metal, counters a heat metal spell or else causes metal to act as follows: Metal Temperature Damage per Round cold none icy 1-2 points freezing* 1d4 points* On the final round of freezing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer from the numbing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM rules the saving throw was failed badly) for 1d4 days. During this time, the character's grip is extremely weak and he cannot use that hand for fighting or any other activity requiring a firm grasp. The chill metal spell is countered by a resist cold spell, or by any great heat--proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere torch), a magical flaming sword, a wall of fire spell, etc. Under water, this version of the spell inflicts no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, exerting an upward buoyancy."

Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and it affects persons selected by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at three persons, each gets a normal saving throw; if only two persons are being enspelled, each rolls his saving throw with a -1 penalty; if the spell is cast at only one person, the saving throw die roll suffers a -2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. The priest casting the hold person spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise, the duration is six rounds at 3rd level, eight rounds at 4th level, etc. The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell."

If the saving throw is failed, the animal advances toward the priest and awaits his bidding. The priest can communicate with the animal in a crude fashion, telling it to go to a certain place, but directions must be simple. The spellcaster can attach some small item or note to the animal. If so instructed, the animal will then wait at that location until the duration of the spell expires.

As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it strikes at any opponent within its range, as desired. Each round the caster canchoose to attack the same target as the previous round or switch to a new target that he can see anywhere within his maximum range. The spiritual hammer's chance to successfully hit is equal to that of the caster, without any Strength bonuses. In addition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4 points on larger opponents, plus the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing, so if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with the loss of any modifications to the target's AC for shield and Dexterity. As soon as the caster ceases concentration, the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dispel magic spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes. If the hammer is successfully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the hammer has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell. The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest must hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast."

Creatures moving at a very rapid pace (running) when tripped suffer 1 point of damage and are stunned for 1d4+1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is very hard (if it is turf or other soft material, they are merely stunned for the rest of that round). Very large creatures, such as elephants, are not affected at all by a trip spell. The object continues to trip all creatures passing over it, including the spellcaster, for as long as the spell duration lasts. A creature aware of the object and its potential adds a +4 bonus to its saving throw roll when crossing the object. The enchanted object is 80% undetectable unless a means that detects magical traps is employed or the operation of the spell is observed. This spell does not function under water."

    "Description": "When this spell is cast, the priest causes a volume of wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. The range of a warp wood spell is 10 yards for each level of experience of the caster. It affects approximately a 15- inch shaft of wood of up to 1-inch diameter per level of the caster. Thus, at 1st level, a caster might be able to warp a hand axe handle or four crossbow bolts; at 5th level, he could warp the shaft of a typical spear. Note that boards or planks can also be affected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat or ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are useless; warped melee weapons suffer a -4 penalty to their attack rolls. Enchanted wood is affected only if the spellcaster is of higher level than the caster of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster has a 20% cumulative chance of success per level of difference (20% if one level higher, 40% if two levels higher, etc.). Thus, a door magically held or wizard locked by a 5th-level wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a warp wood spell cast by a 7th-level priest. Wooden magical items are considered enchanted at 12th level (or better). Extremely powerful items, such as artifacts, are unaffected by this spell. The reversed spell, straighten wood, straightens bent or crooked wood, or reverses the effects of a warp wood spell, subject to the same restrictions."

Thus, a 5th-level priest can withdraw for seven rounds to cogitate on some matter while one round passes for all others. (The DM should allow the player one minute of real time per round withdrawn to ponder some problem or question. No discussion with other players is permitted.) Note that while affected by the withdraw spell, the caster can use only the following spells: any divination spell or any curing or healing spell, the latter on himself only. The casting of any of these spells in different fashion (for example, a cure light wounds spell bestowed upon a companion) negates the withdraw spell. Similarly, the withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, become invisible, or engage in actions other than thinking, reading, and the like. He can be affected by the actions of others, losing any Dexterity or shield bonus. Any successful attack upon the caster breaks the spell."

    "Description": "This spell is known as wyvern watch because of the insubstantial haze brought forth by its casting, which vaguely resembles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard some area against intrusion. Any creature approaching within 10 feet of the guarded area may be affected by the \"wyvern.\" Any creature entering the guarded area must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster, until freed by the spellcaster, by a dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis spell. A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature was missed by the attack of the wyvern- form, and the spell remains in place. As soon as a subject creature is successfully struck by the wyvern-form, the paralysis takes effect and the force of the spell dissipates. The spell force likewise dissipates if no intruder is struck by the wyvern-form for eight hours after the spell is cast. Any creature approaching the space being guarded by the wyvern- form may be able to detect its presence before coming close enough to be attacked; this chance of detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twilight conditions, and 0% in darkness. The material component is the priest's holy symbol."

Any time a traveler encounters temperatures in this range, he maintains a comfortable temperature of 70 F., regardless of prevailing weather conditions. Additionally, the spell acts as a shield against rain, snow, and hail, which are blocked by the aura. If a recipient encounters a temperature above or below the stated range, the temperature within the aura is altered by an equal number of degrees. For example, a recipient who encounters a temperature of 150 will actually experience a temperature of 80°F. All physical objects other than rain, snow, and hail can pass through the aura. The recipient can cast spells normally while the aura of comfort is in effect. The spell offers no protection against magically generated weather, such as that caused by weather summoning and ice storm. It does not protect against fire, nor does it shield against fire- or cold-based attacks."

    "Description": "This spell temporarily calms a chaotic situation involving a group of people. The situation may involve any range of emotions from violence (as in a barroom brawl) to joy and merrymaking (as in a festival or carnival). Unlike the emotion spell, calm chaos does not cause a change in the emotions of affected creatures--anger, fear, or intense joy remain in each individual. The emotion is simply restrained rather than released. Thus, an angry character intent on attacking someone will still feel the desire to do so, but he will withhold his action as long as the spell remains in effect. Creatures to be affected are allowed a saving throw vs. spell at a -4 penalty to avoid the effects. If more creatures are present than can be affected, creatures nearest the caster are affected first. After casting the spell, the priest makes a Charisma check. If successful, all characters affected by the spell are compelled to stop what they are doing. They are filled with the sensation that something important is about to occur. At this time, the priest or a character of his choosing must gain the attention of the affected creatures by giving a speech, performing for the crowd, or casting spells with intriguing visual effects (such as dancing lights). The attention of the crowd is then held for as long as the distraction continues. A character could filibuster and maintain control over the affected characters for hours or days. Two conditions will cause the group to resume its original actions. In the first, the method of entertaining the crowd ceases for one round--the speech ends or the spell expires. If this action is not replaced with another distraction within one round, the crowd is freed of the spell. In the second condition, if an event occurs that is more immediate than the distraction, the crowd will divert its attention to that event. Thus, if the spell were used to stop a barroom brawl and the building caught fire or was attacked, the crowd's attention would be diverted and the individuals could act freely. Creatures whose attention is held by the spell cannot be instructed to attack or perform any action. Such creatures will ignore suggestions of this nature. Depending on the nature of the request, the DM may deem that the suggestion causes a distraction that ends the spell. Create Holy Symbol (Conjuration) Sphere: Creation Range: 0 Component: V Duration: Permanent Casting Time: 2 Area of Effect: The caster Saving Throw: None When the words of this spell are uttered, a holy symbol appropriate to the priest's deity appears out of thin air. The item appears in the priest's hands. It may be used as a component for spells or for any other purpose for which the priest would normally use his holy symbol (such as turning undead). He may also opt to give it to a lower level priest of the same deity. The holy symbol is a permanent object."

The spell is cast on any one quantity of food; thus, the priest could cast the spell on the batter of a wedding cake, or he could cast the spell on a quantity of onions as they are diced for both a salad and a stew. The spell affects 10 pounds of food per level of the caster. Anyone who eats the affected food (even a character who eats the salad but not the stew) is subject to the effects of the spell. The effects of the spell begin five rounds after the food has been eaten. At that time, creatures who have eaten the affected food are allowed a saving throw; success indicates that a creature is not affected. Affected creatures quickly become agitated. Petty events ranging from poor table manners to loud talking bother everyone. After five minutes, tempers flare, characters feel compelled to shout at and insult one another, and threats are hurled. Even normally calm characters will feel compelled to vent their frustrations violently. Creatures maintain no alliances while under the effect of dissension's feast. A king and his wife who are normally madly in love will find themselves bickering with each other in a matter of minutes. Members of a diplomatic delegation might come to blows with each other within minutes of eating the food. At the end of the spell duration, characters undergo the sensation of waking up. All are free to behave as they wish. Characters at the meal will still be angry, although they will have no idea why they became angry."

As a result, the caster may choose to increase one ability score (only Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma are eligible) by +1 per three levels of his experience (+1 at 3rd level, +2 at 6th, etc.). Only one attribute may be increased. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell. Attributes may be increased above the normal restrictions due to race and class, to a maximum of +6. All benefits for exceptional attributes listed in the Player's Handbook apply; however, the divine abilities found in the Legends & Lore book cannot be gained by use of this spell. For example, an 18th-level priest with Strength 15 could increase his Strength to 21 for 18 rounds, granting him a +4 attack bonus, a +9 damage adjustment, etc. When the spell ends, the energy abruptly leaves the priest's body, leaving him physically and mentally drained. He is nearly comatose and can do nothing but rest for the next 4d6 turns. A successful Constitution check (at the priest's normal attribute score) reduces this time by 50%. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water that has been blessed by the high priest of the character's faith."

    "Description": "With this spell, the caster can enchant a chest, book, or any other nonliving object no larger than a 10'x10'x10' cube. When any creature other than the caster comes within three feet of the enchanted object, it instantly sprouts appendages and moves away from the creature as quickly as possible. The enchanted object continues to move until it is at least 10 feet away from the nearest creatures in the area. After the enchanted object has moved a satisfactory distance from the nearest creature, the appendages disappear. When a creature again comes within three feet of the enchanted object, the enchanted object sprouts appendages and flees. This process continues until the enchantment is negated (through a dispel magic or similar spell) or the enchanted object is subdued or destroyed. The enchanted object can sprout feet (MV 24), wings (Fl 24, maneuverability class B), or fins (Sw 24), whichever is most advantageous. Thus, a book on a shelf might sprout wings and fly away, while a table might gallop around a room. The enchanted object can freely and instantly trade appendages as necessary. The enchanted object will move only through open spaces. It will not crash through windows, shatter a closed door, or dig through the earth. It cannot attack or take any actions other than movement. If surrounded or cornered, the enchanted object moves in random directions until it is restrained or destroyed. The enchantment ends if the caster voluntarily negates it, if the enchanted object is destroyed (the object has the same vulnerabilities as it has in its normal state), or if the enchanted object is restrained for 2-5 (1d4+1) consecutive rounds. Restraint means that the object is prevented from fleeing; if a creature is able to grapple, lift, or sit on the object, it is considered restrained. A creature capable of lifting the object in its normal state is considered strong enough to restrain it (for instance, a person capable of lifting a 50-pound box is also capable of restraining such a box enchanted by frisky chest). The object may also be restrained by tossing a net or heavy blanket over it or by surrounding it with several characters. The material components are a dried frog's leg, a feather, and a fish scale."

Mind read will always reveal the kind of creature being probed, although this identity may be couched in the creature's own language or in a (possibly distorted) body image. The spell has a 20% chance of revealing the character class of an individual. The details and the usefulness of the creature's thoughts will depend on the intelligence of the subject. While a priest could read the thoughts of an animal, he would probably receive only a confused jumble of emotions and instincts. Reading the mind of a highly intelligent wizard, however, would be much more illuminating; the priest might be amazed by the crystal clarity and deep insight of the wizard's mental processes. If mind read is used as part of an interrogation, an intelligent and wary subject receives a saving throw at a -2 penalty. If successful, the creature resists the spell's effects and the priest learns no information. If the saving throw is failed, the priest may learn additional information according to the DM's ruling."

    "Description": "Theoretically, every action has a particular moment at which it will have its greatest possible effect. Using the arcane mathematics of this spell, the priest can determine the \"ideal moment\" for any single action in each round that the spell is in effect. This action must be performed by a character other than the priest. In practice, another character informs the priest of an action he wants to undertake in a round. The priest concentrates on the action, then informs the character when the \"correct moment\" has come. The character then gains a bonus of 20% (+4 on a d20) to the success of his action. The spell can affect only a single action in a given round. When used in combat, the priest can advise the best moment to initiate an action (affecting initiative) or what moment offers the greatest success in striking (affecting the chance to hit). If the character seeks advice concerning initiative, he gains a -2 modifier to the initiative roll, but only at the cost of -2 on his chance to hit. Characters who seek the best attack frequently delay their actions. These characters suffer a +1 on their initiative roll but gain a +4 on their chance to hit. The spell cannot affect the amount of damage caused, since the act (striking) has already succeeded at that point. Characters are not obliged to wait for the moment specified by the priest. For example, a fighter might decide that striking first is more important than gaining +4 to hit. The character can act normally, based on his or her unmodified initiative. The character gains no bonus from the moment spell, and the priest can affect no other action in that round. Noncombat actions can also benefit from the moment spell. For example, a thief planning to climb a wall may wait to start her climb until the priest informs her that the moment is right. If she waits, she gains a bonus of 20% to her Climb Walls roll (in this case, the bonus is subtracted from her roll). While concentrating on this spell, the priest can take no other action. A break in the priest's concentration--taking damage in combat, for example--terminates the spell instantly. The material component is a set of three silver dice, which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The dice are not consumed in the casting."

    "Description": "With this spell, the priest creates tones and harmonies of such unearthly beauty and complexity that they entrance the listener, making it difficult for the listener to attack or otherwise harm the priest. The listener receives a normal saving throw against this effect. Failure means that the listener is entranced and is unable to attack the priest for the duration of the spell. In addition, the music makes the subject gullible and more susceptible to charm magics such as charm person, suggestion, and hypnotism. While the music spell is in effect, the subject saves against charm spells with a -3 penalty. This spell does not protect other characters in company with the priest; listeners who have fallen prey to the music are free to attack anyone else. The spell effect ends instantly if the priest takes any hostile action against a creature under the influence of the spell. Music of the spheres can affect one creature per three levels of the priest (one subject at 3rd level, two at 6th level, etc.). Subjects must be within a 20-foot-diameter circle. Potential victims must have Intelligence of at least 1 (necessary to understand the concept of music) and must be able to hear the music (i.e., they cannot be deaf and there can be nothing obstructing the victim's ears). This also means that the level of background noise must be low enough for the music to be audible. The DM should assume that the music is the same volume as an average human's normal speaking voice. If the potential subject could not hear speech at the appropriate range under prevailing conditions, the spell cannot affect that subject. The spell would be virtually useless in the midst of a full-scale battle or during a hurricane. The material component comprises a set of three small bows made from fine silver, each costing 100 gp. The lengths of the bows must be in the ratio of 1 to 4 to 9. The priest strokes these bows together in an intricate sequence while casting the spell. The bows are not consumed in the casting."

On one round, a priest (or priests) casts the mystic transfer. The spell is then active for the remaining nine rounds of the turn. Mystic transfer allows a priest to receive spells from another priest of the same ethos. Any priest of the same religion can cast a spell and transfer it to a second priest within that spell's maximum range. The spell does not take effect; instead, it is channelled through the mystic transfer into the receiving priest. This priest must immediately cast the spell or pass it to another priest cloaked in a mystic transfer within the spell's range. Any number of transfers can be made in the same round, provided each new recipient is within spell range of the previous recipient. If the spell is not transferred, the spell takes effect. For example, a 3rd-level priest casts a mystic transfer. On the following round, a 10th-level priest \"passes\" a flame strike to the 3rd-level priest. The two priests could be 60 yards apart (the maximum range of the flame strike). The 3rd-level priest could then use the flame strike to attack any target within 60 yards, or could pass the spell on to another priest who has an active mystic transfer. The spell passed by the mystic transfer has the range, area of effect, damage, and other effects equal to the level of the original caster. In the example above, the flame strike would function as if cast by a 10th-level priest. The mystic transfer does not require concentration. However, on any round in which a priest is receiving and/or transferring a spell, the caster cannot take any other significant action. A priest can receive spells only from priests who worship the same deity and who specifically target spells to him. Area effect spells may be passed. A priest can never use mystic transfer to pluck an opponent's spells out of the air."

    "Description": "This cooperative spell allows the priests to create a beneficial atmosphere within a specified area. Companions of similar alignment to the casters will feel fortified and encouraged while in the sanctified area. The spell can be cast by a single priest or a group of priests. After casting sanctify, the affected area is imbued with the deity's majesty. For followers of that deity, the area radiates a holy aura. These followers gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against all fear- and charm-based powers (a +2 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM™ rules units). Persons of the same alignment as the caster but of different faiths gain a +1 to saving throws (+1 in BATTLESYSTEM rules). The effect applies only as long as the characters remain in the sanctified area. Creatures intent on harming the priest or his followers suffer a -1 on saving throws vs. fear and charm (-1 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units) when on sanctified ground. Undead creatures within the area are easier to turn; any priest standing on sanctified ground turns undead as if he were one level higher. Although this spell can be cast by a single priest, it is most effective when cast by several priests at once. The duration of the spell is equal to one round per level of the caster. When several priests cast the spell, the level of the most powerful priest is used, with two rounds added for every contributing priest. Thus, one 8th-level and three 6th- level priests would give the spell a duration of 14 rounds (8+2+2+2). Sanctify is often used in conjunction with focus to protect the grounds of a temple or encourage men defending a castle. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dirt from the grounds of an existing temple of the same faith. The reverse of this spell, defile, functions in an identical manner with respect to saving throws for charm and fear. However, priests standing on defiled ground who attempt to turn undead do so at one level lower than their current level. The material components for the reverse are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of earth from a grave."

Creatures are allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects; those who fail the save are affected fully. Affected characters are aware of this enchantment; therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. When a character leaves the area, he is free to speak as he chooses. The spell affects a square whose sides are five feet long per level of the caster; thus, a 4th-level priest could affect a 20 foot by 20 foot square.

    "Duration": "1 turn + 2 rds/lvl",
    "Description": "Her the duration of this spell, a priest becomes completely deaf to all normal sounds and may hear only the noise of other creatures' beating hearts. The heartbeat of each person, animal, or monster in the area of effect is clearly distinct and may convey information about the being's proximity, direction, size, emotional distress, general health, and race or species. For instance, the heartbeat of a frail old wizard would be much softer and weaker than that of the invisible ogre bodyguard, standing behind him. This spell can provide quite confusing results if cast in the presence of numerous individuals (such as on a crowded city street) and is most effective when cast by a cleric in relative seclusion. A priest never hearshis or her own heartbeat with this spell. It is effectively masked out by the power of the hear heartbeat spell. Obviously, this spell is of little use with creatures without functioning hearts (such as plants or undead). The spell's range is diminished if more than a one- inch thickness of wood, stone, or metal lies between the caster and a subject. Each inch of a barrier's thickness should be treated as 10' of open space. The material component is beeswax mixed with a tiny drop of the priest's own blood (to block the sound of his or her own heartbeat). While casting the spell, the priest places the wax in his ears to blot out normal sound and trigger the magical effect. Note that the priest is completely oblivious to normal sounds (such as talking or music) while the spell is in effect."

This resistance roll is made secretly by the DM before each turning attempt is made. A single priest can continue attempting to turn or command the resistant undead creatures each round until either the resistance is overcome or the turn roll indicates failure. The spell can be centered on a stationary object or upon any moving creature, including the caster."

    "Duration": "Permanent",
    "Description": "This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The priest can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated, the number is determined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate 12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. Note thatthis is based on the standard racial Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer would be animated as a skeleton or zombie of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class or racial abilities. The caster can, alternatively, animate two small animal skeletons (1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experience he has achieved. The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece of flesh of the type of creature being animated, and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. Casting this spell is not a good act, and only evil priests use it frequently."

The caster is then able to call down bolts of lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn. The caster need not call a bolt of lightning immediately--other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed; however, the caster must remain stationary and concentrate for a full round each time a bolt is called. The spell has a duration of one turn per caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a 6d8 bolt (2d8+4d8). The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever distance the spellcaster decides, up to 360 yards away. Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the path or the point where the lightning strikes suffers full damage unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case only one-half damage is taken. Because it requires a storm overhead, this spell can only be used outdoors. It does not function under ground or under water."

    "Description": "This spell is similar to a light spell, except that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts until negated by magical darkness or by a dispel magic spell. Creatures with penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell, this can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. In the third case, the continual light affects the space about 1 foot behind a creature that successfully rolls its saving throw vs.spell (a failed saving throw means the continual light is centered on the creature and moves as it moves). Note that this spell also blinds a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a continual light spell against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both. This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years. The reverse spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of light (pitch blackness), similar to the darkness spell but of greater duration and area."

    "Description": "This spell enables the caster to cure most diseases by placing his hand upon the diseased creature. The affliction rapidly disappears thereafter, making the cured creature whole and well in from one turn to 10 days, depending on the type of disease and the state of its advancement when the cure took place. (The DM must adjudicate these conditions.) The spell is also effective against parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot grubs, and others. When cast by a priest of at least 12th level, this spell cures lycanthropy if cast within three days of the infection. Note that the spell does not prevent reoccurrence of a disease if the recipient is again exposed. The reverse of the cure disease spell is cause disease. To be effective, the priest must touch the intended victim, and the victim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity of the disease is decided by the priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact details of the disease are decided by the DM, but the following are typical: Debilitating: The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1 point of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10% of its hit points per Strength loss, down to 10% of its original hit points. If the disease also affects hit points, use the more severe penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3 weeks. Fatal: This wasting disease is effective immediately. Infected creatures receive no benefit from cure wound spells while the disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal within 1d6 months and can be cured only by magical means. Each month the disease progresses, the creature loses 2 points of Charisma, permanently. The inflicted disease can be cured by the cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be caused."

In addition, paralysis, poison, or energy level drain does not affect a person under the influence of this spell, but poison injected or otherwise introduced into the body becomes effective when the spell recipient is no longer under the influence of this spell, although a saving throw is permitted. However, the spell offers no protection from causes of certain death--being crushed under a landslide, etc. Only a willing individual can be affected by a feign death spell. The priest is able to end the spell effect at any time, but it requires a full round for bodily functions to begin again.

    "Duration": "Until discharged",
    "Description": "A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorizedor hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. The priest must set the conditions of the ward; typically any creature violating the warded area without speaking the name of the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. Glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics, such as creature type, size, and weight. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good or evil, or to pass those of the caster's religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded. When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. For every 5 square feet of area to be protected, one round is required to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The caster can affect an area equal to a square the sides of which are the same as his level, in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the caster's total square footage. Thus, a 6th-level caster could place a glyph on a 6-foot x 6-foot square, a 4-foot x 9-foot rectangle, a 2-foot x 18- foot band, or a 1-foot by 36-foot strip. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become invisible. The priest traces the glyph with incense, which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet, must be sprinkled with powdered diamond (at least 2,000 gp worth). Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster, explode for a like amount of fire damage, paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The DM may allow any harmful priest spell effect to be used as a glyph, provided the caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell. Successful saving throws either reduce effects by one- half or negate them, according to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled by magic and foiled by high-level thieves using their find-and-remove-traps skill. The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to a priest depend on his religion, and he might make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules."

Each animal gets a saving throw: If only one is the subject of the spell, it has a penalty of -4 on its roll; if two are subject, each receives a penalty of -2 on its roll; if three are subject, each receives apenalty of -1 on its roll; and if four are subject, each gets an unmodified saving throw.

Once the caster has fixed in his mind the items sought, the spell locates only that item. Attempting to find a specific item, such as a kingdom's crown, requires an accurate mental image. If the image is not close enough to the actual item, the spell does not work; in short, desired but unique objects cannot be located by this spell unless they are known by the caster.

While in the stone, the priest remains in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which he melded. The priest remains aware of the passage of time. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen or heard, however. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm the priest, but its partial destruction, if enough so that the caster no longer fits, expels the priest with 4d8 points of damage. The stone's destruction expels the priest and slays him instantly, unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell. The magic lasts for 1d8+8 rounds, with the variable part of the duration rolled secretly by the DM. At any time before the duration expires, the priest can step out of the stone through the stone surface he entered. If the duration runs out, or the effect is dispelled before the priest exits the stone, he is violently expelled and suffers 4d8 points of damage. The following spells harm the priest if cast upon the stone that he is occupying: stone to flesh expels the priest and inflicts 4d8 points of damage; stone shape causes 4d4 points of damage, but does not expel the priest; transmute rock to mud expels and slays him instantly unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell; and passwall expels the priest without damage."

This protection is proof against only one such attack, dissipating immediately whether or not the saving throw was successful. If the saving throw is failed, the spell recipient suffers double the usual physical damage, in addition to the loss of experience or Strength that normally occurs.

Thus, an 8th-level caster can affect a maximum area of a 160-foot x 160-foot square, a 320-foot x 80-foot rectangle, a 640-foot x 40-foot rectangle, a 1,280-foot x 20-foot rectangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such magical means as a dispel magic spell. The second use of the spell affects a one-mile square area. The DM secretly makes a saving throw (based on the caster's level) to see if the spell takes effect. If successful, the spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful, and hardy, increasing yields by 20% to 50% ([1d4+1] x 10%), given a normal growing season. The spell does not prevent disaster in the form of floods, drought, fire, or insects, although even in these cases the plants survive better than expected. This effect lasts only for the life cycle of one season, the winter \"death\" marking the end of a life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees. In many farming communities, this spell is normally cast at planting time as part of the spring festivals."

Creatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the area that have an unobstructed line of sight to the effect are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds unless they roll successful saving throws vs. spell. The fireworks fill a volume 10 times greater than the original fire source. Second, it can cause a thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster. This covers a roughly hemispherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source. The spell uses one fire source within the area of effect, which is immediately extinguished. If an extremely large fire is used as the source, it is only partially extinguished by the casting. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per caster level. This spell does not function under water."

Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th level or more can cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it on the animal form. The were-creature receives a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, the spell fails and the priest must gain a level before attempting the remedy on this creature again. The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for every experience level of the priest using the spell. The curse can have one of the following effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's attack and saving throw rolls by -4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, in the case of creatures not using tools)--roll each round. It is possible for a priest to devise his own curse, and it should be similar in power to those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a bestow curse spell must be touched. If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled."

When the snare spell is cast upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings. One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle (note that the head of a worm or snake could be thus ensnared). If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The magic of the spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, inflicting 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped, and lifting it off the ground by the trapped member(s) (or strangling it if the head/neck triggered the snare). If no such sapling or tree is available, the cordlike object tightens upon the member(s), then wraps around the entire creature, causing no damage, but tightly binding it. Under water, the cord coils back upon its anchor point. The snare is magical, so for one hour it is breakable only by cloud giant or greater Strength (23); each hour thereafter, the snare material loses magic so as to become 1 point more breakable per hour--22 after two hours, 21 after three, 20 after four--until six full hours have elapsed. At that time, 18 Strength will break the bonds. After 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of the snare lose all magical properties and the loop opens, freeing anything it held. The snare can be cut with any magical weapon, or with any edged weapon wielded with at least a +2 attack bonus (from Strength, for example). The caster must have a snake skin and a piece of sinew from a strong animal to weave into the cordlike object from which he will make the snare. Only the caster's holy symbol is otherwise needed."

Of course, the priest must be able to converse in the language that the dead creature once used. The length of time the creature has been dead is a factor, since only higher level priests can converse with a long-dead creature. The number of questions that can be answered and the length of time in which the questions can be asked depend on the level of experience of the priest. Even if the casting is successful, such creatures are as evasive as possible when questioned. The dead tend to give extremely brief and limited answers, often cryptic, and to take questions literally. Furthermore, their knowledge is often limited to what they knew in life. A dead creature of different alignment or of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster's level receives a saving throw vs. spell. A dead creature that successfully saves can refuse to answer questions, ending the spell. At the DM's option, the casting of this spell on a given creature might be restricted to once per week.

In effect, the ground cover, while appearing to be unchanged,acts as if the area were strewn with caltrops. In areas of bare ground or earthen pits, roots and rootlets act in the same way. For each 10 feet of movement through the area, the victim suffers 2d4 points of damage. He must also roll a saving throw vs. spell. If this saving throw is failed, the victim's movement rate is reduced by 1/3 of its current total (but a creature's movement rate can never be less than 1). This penalty lasts for 24 hours, after which the character's normal movement rate is regained. Without the use of a spell such as true seeing, similar magical aids, or some other special means of detection (such as detect traps or detect snares and pits), an area affected by spike growth is absolutely undetectable as such until a victim enters the area and suffers damage. Even then, the creature cannot determine the extent of the perilous area unless some means of magical detection is used. The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and either seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point."

Flying insects appear 70% of the time, while crawling insects appear 30% of the time. The exact insects called are bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast. This gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster points to. The attacked creature sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee or fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative roll should be made for the insects to see if their damage occurs before the spell is cast. If it does, the victim's concentration is ruined and the spell is lost. The insects disperse and the spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames. Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm might possibly be outrun, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If evaded, the summoned insects can be sent against another opponent, but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they leave the former opponent and attack the new victim. Crawling insects can travel only about 10 feet per round (maximum speed over smooth ground) and flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The caster must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is disturbed. It is possible, in underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This spell does not function under water. The materials needed for this spell are the caster's holy symbol, a flower petal, and a bit of mud or wet clay."

The creature is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell; if it fails, the caster may direct the creature with simple commands to act in any fashion desired. Sample commands include attack, run, fetch, etc. Suicidal or self-destructive commands grant the subject another saving throw to break free of the caster’s control, with a +1 to +4 bonus depending on the extremity of the caster’s orders. Ordering an animal to engage in combat is not necessarily self-destructive, as long as the prospective opponent is not more than three times the animal’s Hit Dice or more than two size categories larger than the subject. For example, a wolf (3 Hit Dice, size M) would attack a troll (6+6 Hit Dice, size L) without hesitation, but it might break free of the caster’s control if ordered to attack a size H dragon or an 8+8 HD umber hulk. Control animal establishes a mental link between the caster and the subject, and the animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains within range. Because the caster’s intelligence directs the animal, the creature may be able to take actions normally beyond its own comprehension, such as manipulating objects with its paws and mouth. The caster need not concentrate in order to maintain control of the creature unless he is trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn’t. Control animal only works on normal or giant-sized animals with Intelligence ratings between 1 and 4. Magical animals, monsters, and creatures of low Intelligence or higher are immune to the effects of this spell. Druids always avoid using this spell."

The dictate spell is an improved version of command, affecting up to 6 creatures in a 20-foot cube. The caster is not limited to a single word and can issue an order of no more than a dozen words in length. All the specified targets who fail their saving throws must attempt to obey the caster’s instructions. For example, a priest could issue a dictate such as “Stay here until I return,” “Throw down your weapons,” or “Seize that elf!” The subjects will continue to obey nonimmediate orders for up to one round per experience level of the caster. Subjects who cannot understand the caster are not affected, so characters who do not understand the caster’s language are immune to this spell. In addition, the order must create an immediate and obvious course of action for the subject; a dictate to “Die!” or “Feel sorry for him!” would simply cause the subject to stand still in confusion for one round. Poorly worded or confusing commands grant the subjects a +1 to +4 bonus on their saving throws at the DM’s discretion. Similarly, if after the subject fails his saving throw he is given an obviously self-destructive dictate, the subject simply loses his next round as he fights off the compulsion."

First, the priest may not leave the Border Ethereal and venture into the Deep Ethereal; therefore, at the end of the spell’s duration, he must return to the Prime Material Plane whether he wants to or not. Secondly, the priest may not use this spell on an unwilling target and can only make another creature ethereal if the subject is willing and in physical contact with the priest when the spell is cast. Besides himself, the caster can bring one creature per two experience levels (three at 5th, four at 7th, five at 9th, and so on) to the Ethereal Plane. Even if the priest abandons his charges in the Border Ethereal, the stranded characters will automatically materialize when the spell ends. While ethereal, the priest cannot be detected by any means short of a true seeing or detect phase spell. He perceives his surroundings as misty, gray, and otherworldly. No action he takes can affect the physical world, but he can pass through walls, doors, and other solid objects without hindrance. The priest can choose to end the spell voluntarily at any time, materializing in the physical world in one round. If the caster occupies a solid object when the spell ends, he is hurled into the Deep Ethereal and stranded in a catatonic stupor until he can be rescued."

Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the ditch-and-dike. Large, open rooms or chambers with few features may fall into this category. B. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones and boulders, deadwood, and patches of dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall or rampart along the perimeter of the area of effect. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 75% cover (+7 bonus to AC), or 50% cover if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. In hand-to-hand combat, the wall’s defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls; man-sized attackers must spend one full round in climbing over the wall in order to enter the fortified area. Natural caverns and large, cluttered chambers fall into this category, as well. C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In areas such as swamp, marsh, bog, or tundra, fortify cannot raise a wall or dike to cover the defenders. Instead, the spell creates a water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 10 feet wide and 2 to 4 feet deep; most creatures require 1 full round to negotiate the ditch, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up the other side. The fortifications are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and excavations, clearing, or filling can quickly raze the site, returning it to its original state. The material component is the shell of a snail dusted with 100 gold pieces worth of diamond powder. In Battlesystem® rules, fortify provides a defending unit with a +2 bonus to its AR against missile and melee attacks, but no bonus against missile attacks in marshy or low-lying areas."

    "CastingTime": "6",
    "Duration": "1 round/level",
    "Description": "This spell summons a minor spirit or entity to the caster’s aid. Clerics usually summon minor elementals of some kind, while shamans typically conjure an animal spirit or spirit of nature. Regardless of the spirit’s origin, it appears as a ghostly beast of some kind—wolves, bears, tigers, or lions are most common. The animal spirit obeys the mental commands of the priest, attacking his enemies or performing any other task that it could reasonably accomplish. The creature is incorporeal and cannot handle or manipulate objects of any kind, but it can see and hear as a normal animal of its archetype and could be used to scout a dangerous area or act as a distraction of some kind. In combat, the animal spirit has the following statistics: MV 24; AC 4; THAC0 15; Dmg 2d4. It can only be injured by magical weapons and can strike monsters hit only by +1 or better weapons. The spirit has a number of hit points equal to 10 plus the caster’s level, so a 6th-level priest conjures a animal spirit with 16 hit points. The creature is not affected by charm, sleep, hold, or other mind-affecting spells and suffers no damage from cold-based attacks. However, it is vulnerable to dispel magic or turning as an undead monster of the caster’s Hit Dice. If the animal spirit is turned, destroyed, or dispelled, the priest who summoned it must make a saving throw vs. spell or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Because the spirit is intelligent and free-willed under the caster’s direction, the priest need not concentrate in order to direct its attacks—an animal spirit could be ordered to attack a spellcaster in the back of an enemy party, while the cleric waded into hand-to-hand combat. The animal spirit makes use of flank or rear attacks when it can and gains any normal combat bonuses that a living creature in its position would be entitled to. The priest enjoys instantaneous, silent communication with the animal spirit and can order it to stop attacking, to change its target, or to undertake almost any conceivable action desired. However, the spirit must remain within the spell’s range; if it is ever more than 10 yards per caster level away from the priest, it dissipates harmlessly. The material component is a small whistle carved from a bone taken from the appropriate type of animal."

    "CastingTime": "1",
    "Duration": "1 day/level",
    "Description": "This spell is an improved version of slow poison, with a duration measured in days rather than hours. When cast upon a victim who has been poisoned by any means, hold poison arrests the venom and prevents it from doing any additional damage to the victim. (In most cases, the spell must be cast during the poison’s onset time in order to be effective.) Damage that has already been inflicted is not restored, but as long as the hold poison is in effect, the victim can be cured or healed of damage caused by poison by any normal means. This spell can be used to indefinitely postpone the onset of a poison if the caster chooses to continue to cast it on the poisoned character before the previous hold poison wears off. However, each time a new hold poison is used to stop the venom’s advance for another few days, there is a 2% cumulative chance that the spell fails and the poison runs its course. Evil priests have been known to deliberately poison a person and then use this spell to grant the victim a stay of death for a few days. This can be an extremely effective threat if the victim doesn’t have access to a neutralize poison spell. The material component is the priest’s holy symbol and a bud of garlic, crushed and smeared on the injury (or eaten if the poison was ingested)."

    "AoE": "Creature touched",
    "CastingTime": "1 turn",
    "Duration": "Instantaneous",
    "Description": "Repair injury is intended for use in campaigns featuring the critical hit or critical strike rules. This spell addresses one specific injury or wound (see Chapter 8). It can be used to knit a broken bone, alleviate the swelling and pain of a sprain or a twist, or repair soft-tissue damage such as an injured eye, ear, or a severed tendon. If used as a simple curing spell, repair injury restores 1d10+1 hit points to the injured character, but if used to address the effects of a specific injury, repair injury automatically removes one grazed, struck, injured, or broken condition, and alleviates any combat, movement, or maximum hit point penalties associated with the injury in question. The spell does not restore any lost hit points to the victim, other than the 1d10+1 that are incidental to the working of the spell. Beran, a fighter with 44 hit points, is struck by an ogre’s club. The blow inflicts 12 points of damage, but Beran also suffers a broken hip. This injury will reduce him to a maximum of 25% of his normal total, so Beran’s current hit points drop from 32 to 11 after the battle ends. In addition, he is not capable of moving or attacking due to the effects of the injury. When the smoke clears, Talmos the priest comes to Beran’s aid. Using repair injury, he knits Beran’s broken hip. The spell cures 6 hit points in the process. Beran no longer suffers the movement or attack penalties for a broken hip and has 17 hit points to his credit. With time or additional healing, he can regain his normal total of 44. Repair injury is also helpful in dealing with wounds that fall in the crushed, shattered, or destroyed category. This spell reduces the severity of the injury to the broken level, which means it heals as if it were 20d6 lost hit points. Only one repair injury can be used on any given wound, so a character with a shattered knee could still require a lot of time to recover after an application of this spell. Severed limbs, destroyed eyes or ears, and ability score losses caused by injuries cannot be healed by this spell. Repair injury is the equivalent of cure serious wounds for the purpose of slowing or stopping bleeding."

    "CastingTime": "6",
    "Duration": "1 turn + 2 rds./level",
    "Description": "By anticipating possible futures and outcomes of the caster’s actions, this spell provides the character with a temporary sixth sense or feel for danger. The spell operates on a subconscious level, and the caster receives strong intuitive impulses when he contemplates courses of action that may bring immediate physical injury or harm to him. For example, if the priest was about to open a trapped chest, the unfailing premonition would create a flash of insight or a gut feeling telling him that he shouldn’t do so. Similarly, opening a door that leads into the lair of a ferocious troll may also trigger the spell’s warning. Threatening a NPC who is likely to respond by drawing a weapon and attacking the PC would create a warning, but threatening a NPC who will get even with the priest in an hour or two will not trigger the premonition. The unfailing premonition is also quite useful in combat, as long as the priest obeys his instincts and ducks, dodges, or withdraws when his subconscious tells him to. While the spell is in effect, the priest gains a +2 bonus to his Armor Class and saving throws, but in any given round there is a 25% chance that he will have to forego his intended action in order to obey the spell’s warning impulses. The premonition only works on actions undertaken by the priest himself. If his companion is about to pull a mysterious lever that will drop a 10-ton block of stone on the priest, he receives no warning."

    "Components": "V, S",
    "AoE": "Special",
    "CastingTime": "6",
    "Duration": "1 rd./level",
    "Description": "This spell allows the priest to exert fine control over air currents and winds, possibly extinguishing small fires or manipulating light objects as he sees fit within the spell’s range. Generally, the priest is limited to one discrete action per round since he must focus his wind servant tightly on any given task. The wind servant can affect objects or creatures weighing up to 1 pound per caster level, twice as much if the object is reasonably light or airy (a cloak, scroll, or haystack, for instance), or 10 times as much if the object is designed to be carried by the wind, such as a ship’s sail or a bird in flight. If an object is within the spell’s weight limit, the caster may direct the wind servant to carry it along in gusts and air currents at a flying movement rate of 12 (E). If the object leaves the limits of the spell’s range, the wind servant fails, and the object drops or falls normally from that point. Flying creatures of size M or smaller can be forced to land or be driven away by use of the spell if they fall within the weight limit, or slowed by 50% if they exceed the weight limit. Employing the wind servant against an arrow or light missile adds a penalty of –4 to the attack roll. In dusty, snowy, or sandy regions, the caster can instead use wind servant to create a vicious zephyr of stinging dust around an enemy. This zephyr inflicts damage equal to the opponent’s base AC less 2d6 points and creates a –2 penalty to the victim’s attack rolls. For example, an enemy in leather armor +1 (AC 7) would suffer 7 – 2d6 damage if attacked by means of this spell. Note that any use of the wind servant requires the priest’s undivided attention; he can take no other actions while directing the spell."

The priest can cancel the spell before the duration expires if desired. The material component is a pinch of clay dust. The second effect requires preparation in advance. The priest and unit must be within 100 yards of a place of worship dedicated to the casting priest's deity. The casting time is 5 turns. At the conclusion of the casting, the unit gains the benefit described above, with two main differences. First, the unit does not lose the benefit of fighting in its own actual favored terrain (the unit effectively has two favored terrains). Second, the spell endures until the next sunset.

The astral window ranges in size from one square foot up to a 10'x10' square, at the caster's choosing. The window is not mobile, and if the priest moves more than 5 yards away from it, it immediately vanishes and the spell ends. By stating a subject's name, the priest may view a specific creature or object in the window. More than one subject may be viewed during the spell's duration. Each time a new subject is chosen, the window becomes streaked with grey as the Astral plane flies past. This continues for 1d4 rounds, until the window finally focuses upon the chosen subject. If the person is not in the Astral plane, the window instead chooses a random location. The window operates from both sides; creatures in the Astral plane can see the priest as easily as he can see them. Verbal communication is not possible, however. Normally, creatures cannot pass through the window. If an attempt is made, there is a base 5% chance of success. This is modified by +1% per level or Hit Dice of the individual. In order to pass through, the creature or object must be small enough to fit through the window; otherwise, only a portion of the subject may reach through (such as a monster's arm or searching tongue). By casting the astral window spell, a character who subsequently casts the 7th-level astral spell may choose to arrive in the Astral plane at the place shown in the window."

    "Description": "This spell allows a priest to plant a section of ground with magically created caltrops. The spell can create two kinds of caltrops: infantry and cavalry. The first are of small size and are designed to harm foot soldiers. The latter are larger and cause serious damage to cavalry or units composed of size L or larger creatures. Cavalry caltrops are so large that size M or smaller creatures can easily step around them. This prevents damage to infantry units. Each time a unit moves into a planted area, the unit suffers an attack of AD4 (for infantry caltrops) or AD6 (for cavalry caltrops). Units charging through a planted area suffer double damage. If a unit ends its movement in a caltrop-sown region, it suffers another attack when it moves out of the area. This spell can create a rectangular field of infantry caltrops up to 160 square yards in area (e.g., 4 yards x 40 yards, 2 yards x 80 yards, etc.), or a field of cavalry caltrops up to 90 square yards in area (e.g., 3 yards x 30 yards, 2 yards x 45 yards, etc.). Ordinary caltrops make no distinction between friend or foe; all creatures entering a caltrop-sown area suffer the same consequences. The same is true of magical caltrops, with one exception: the casting priest can terminate the spell at any time, causing the caltrops to vanish and leaving the terrain clear. Unlike normal caltrops, a region sown with magical caltrops cannot be \"swept\" clear; the magical caltrops remain in place until the spell terminates. The material component is a golden caltrop."

The caster indicates the desired area for the campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less) and the number of persons the campsite is to accommodate (a number of persons equal to three times the level of the caster). The servants clear the area of debris, set up tents and bedrolls, start a campfire, fetch water, and prepare a bland meal. The campsite is so skillfully prepared that it blends with the surrounding terrain, reducing the chance that the camp could be noticed by 50%. Campfires, loud noises, and other activities can negate this. The entire process takes 4-16 (4d4) rounds to complete. The servants make camp with the gear and equipment provided for them; otherwise, the servants will improvise with materials available in the immediate area (50 yards of the designated campsite). For instance, if the party has no tents or beds, the servants will construct crude but comfortable beds of weeds and grass and temporary shelters of leaves and branches. If no materials are available, such as in the desert or similarly barren terrain, the servants will do their best to make the party as comfortable as possible within the environmental limitations. The servants cannot fight for the party, deliver messages, or take any other actions other than creating the campsite. The material components are a piece of string, a bit of wood, and a drop of water. The reverse, break camp, causes the invisible servants to strike a campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less). The servants extinguish fires, dispose of debris, and pack gear for a number of people equal to three times the level of the caster. The entire process takes 4- 16 (4d4) rounds to complete. When completed, all traces of the campsite are eliminated. The material components are the same as those for create campsite."

    "Description": "This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the priest, or in a manner that affects a subject other than the priest. The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed. This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell. If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest's true emotion. The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the DM may allow other similar effects. Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage, and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by) fear. Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage. Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate. Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence, modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked. Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness. Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is countered by) friendship. Hope: The subject's morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is countered by) hopelessness. Hopelessness: The subject's morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope. Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty. The subject's chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is countered by) happiness. All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell. The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting."

The caster can command it to locate a character or creature of the caster's choice based on a physical description. The caster can specify race, sex, and appearance, but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. After the hand receives its orders, it begins to search for the indicated creature, flying at a movement rate of 48. The hand can search within a 5-mile radius of the caster. If the hand is unable to locate the indicated creature, it returns to the caster (provided he is still within the area of effect). The hand displays an outstretched palm, indicating that no such character or creature could be found. The hand then disappears. If the hand locates the indicated subject, the hand beckons the subject to follow it. If the subject follows, the hand points in the direction of the caster, leading the subject in the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before him. Once the hand leads the subject to the caster, it disappears. The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or help the caster. If the subject chooses not to follow the hand, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to the caster, the hand disappears; the subject will have to rely on his own devices to locate the caster. If there is more than one subject within a 5-mile radius that meets the caster's description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand will not seek out a second subject. The ghostly hand has no physical form. The hand can be seen only by the caster and potential targets. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating the subject and leading him back to the caster. The hand will not pass through solid objects, but can pass through small cracks and slits. The material component is a black silk glove."

    "Description": "All invisible creatures who enter an area enchanted with invisibility purge instantly become visible. Invisibility -related spells do not take effect within the boundaries of the enchanted area, and magical devices such as potions of invisibility do not function. Creatures with the natural ability to become invisible are unable to use this ability within the area of effect. Invisible objects carried into the warded area also become visible. Invisible creatures or persons within the area of effect when invisibility purge is cast remain invisible; however, if such creatures exit the area of effect and later re-enter, they instantly become visible. Such creatures also lose any natural ability to turn invisible as long as they remain within the area of effect. A creature who consumes a potion of invisibility outside the warded area becomes invisible normally, but becomes visible when he enters the area of effect; if the duration of the potion of invisibility has not yet expired when he exits the area of effect, he becomes invisible again outside the area. Creatures who are invisible in their natural state or have no visible form (such as invisible stalkers) are not affected by this spell. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a silver mirror no more than three inches in diameter. The invisibility purge can be cast as a cooperative magic spell. The potency of this spell can be increased if several priests cast it at the same time. The duration of the spell is then equal to one turn per level of the most powerful priest, plus one turn for every contributing priest. Each priest also increases the area of effect by one 10'x 10' square (these areas must be contiguous). Thus, a 9th-level priest and two 5th-level priests could create a 30'x 10' invisibility purge area having a duration of 11 turns."

The caster must be within 30 yards of a member of the tribe or village for the spell to have effect. The selected villager must possess the knowledge sought by the caster; for instance, he cannot be an infant, nor can he be mentally unstable or dead (although he can be asleep or unconscious). The selected villager is allowed a saving throw; if he succeeds, the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the caster gains a general knowledge of the villager's local laws and customs, including those that apply to relevant tribal or clan types (such as customs observed by all giants). Typical information revealed by know customs includes common courtesies (outsiders must avert their eyes when addressing local officials), local restrictions (no animals or unaccompanied elves within the city limits), important festivals, and common passwords that are known by the majority of citizens (such as a phrase necessary to pass the guards at the main gate). Additionally, the spell gives the caster a +1 reaction adjustment to encounters with members of the relevant tribe or village. Knowing the local laws and customs does not guarantee that the caster will conduct himself properly. Know customs is to be used as a guide; the DM is free to adjust the quality of information provided by a villager."

    "CastingTime": "1 round",
    "Duration": "1 round/level",
    "Description": "This cooperative spell requires at least two priests to cast the spell simultaneously. During the casting, the priests determine whether the line will be stationary or portable. If the spell is stationary, each priest must inscribe a magical sigil on parallel facing surfaces, such as facing walls of a gatehouse or two tree trunks. If the spell is portable, the priests must stand at each end of the line, thereby anchoring it. After the spell is cast, a shimmering field of force appears between the two anchors (the sigils or priests). The field is 10 feet high and sparkles with energy. Objects on the opposite side of the translucent field, while recognizable, are hazy and indistinct. The field causes 1d3 points of damage to all creatures passing through it; evil creatures and undead suffer 1d8 points of damage from the field. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage. Creatures that can fly over the field, burrow under it, or teleport to the other side are immune to damage. If the spell is cast in its portable form, the priests can move at half their movement rates (limited to the rate of the slower priest). The priests can take no other action, since all their energy is spent in walking and maintaining the field. Once created, the field cannot be increased or decreased in length and must remain straight. The priests could maneuver by pivoting, but could not walk toward each other or bend the field around a corner. If the line of sight between the two priests is blocked by any object of greater than 5' diameter, the spell immediately fails. Thus, creatures, low walls, young trees, pillars, and similar objects will not disrupt the spell. As a cooperative spell, several priests can link together to create a longer field. Each priest (or sigil) forms the end of one field and the beginning of another, much like fenceposts. Each section of the spell must extend in a straight line, but the field can be bent at each junction. Four priests could form a long line, a square, or a Z pattern. The restrictions on moving the fields apply as outlined above. The DM may apply movement penalties depending on the complexity of the pattern. The material components are the priests' croziers, staves, or religious standards, held aloft by each caster. The reverse of this spell, line of destruction, causes 1d3 damage to all creatures passing through it. It causes 1d8 damage to paladins and creatures of good alignment who pass through it. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage."

The time required to view a memory is one-fiftieth of the time that the actual event lasted. Thus, a priest can view the memory of an event that lasted for one hour in a little more than one round. The subject experiences the memory at the same time the caster reads it. The subject must have an Intelligence score of 5 or more and must remain within range of the priest throughout the time it takes to read the desired memory. Priests can cast this spell on unconscious, sleeping, held, or paralyzed creatures. The subject receives a saving throw when the priest casts the spell (this saving throw is allowed even if the subject is asleep or otherwise unaware of the attempt). In addition, if the memory that the priest wants to view concerns something the subject wants to keep secret, or is something that the subject is trying to suppress, the subject receives a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the memory the priest wishes to view is more than six months old, the subject receives a second saving throw, with bonuses depending on the age of the memory as follows: Age of Memory Bonus 6-12 months 0 1 to 4 years +1 5 years or more +3 If the subject succeeds either of these saving throws, the spell fails. This spell creates a mental drain on the priest, causing him to temporarily lose 1-3 points of Constitution. These can be regained only after eight hours of rest. The spell cannot be cast again until the priest's constitution is restored. The material component is a small piece of linen cloth with threads of gold interspersed throughout its weave. This is consumed during the casting."

Thus, if a wizard affected by miscast magic had four 1st-level spells memorized ( armor, feather fall, jump, and sleep) and he attempted to cast the sleep spell, the DM would determine the resulting spell randomly from the wizard's four memorized spells. The wizard has only a 25% chance of casting the sleep spell. Only spells currently memorized are eligible to be exchanged with the desired spell. If a wizard had only one spell memorized, the miscast magic would have no effect and the wizard's spell would be cast normally. The miscast spell operates normally. If a wizard tried to levitate a companion but a web spell resulted, the companion would be trapped by the webs and subject to all resulting effects. If the target of the spell were in range of the levitate spell but not in range of the web, the spell would be lost in a fizzle of energy and the web spell would be wiped from the caster's memory. The wizard who casts the spell performs the proper verbal and somatic components of the spell he wishes to cast; he does not discover the altered results until the wrong spell takes effect. The wizard will also discover that the material component for the resulting spell has vanished (in addition to the material component for the desired spell). Wizards who are targets of miscast magic are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect."

    "Description": "This spell allows the priest to determine the \"tenor of the now\"--in other words, to learn the \"force\" that is most dominant at the time. To cast the spell, the priest generates a series of random numbers and then studies the pattern contained in that string of numbers. This pattern contains information about current conditions. In game terms, when this spell is cast, the DM communicates to the priest's player a single word or short phrase (no more than five words) describing the \"tone\" of the situation. Examples of suitable \"tones\" are \"imminent danger\" (the DM knows a dragon is approaching the area); \"peace and tranquility\" (the woods in which the PCS camp may look threatening, but the area is actually free of evil influence); or \"betrayal\" (one of the PCS' hirelings is actually a spy of their enemy). The DM can make this comment cryptic, but it should always be accurate and contain some useful information. This spell has no specified area of effect. The result of moment reading will always concern the priest and anyone else in his immediate vicinity, but the definition of \"vicinity\" will vary depending on the circumstances. For example, the tenor of the moment might be \"severe danger\" if the priest is entering the territory of a dragon who attacks interlopers on sight. The tenor of the moment is always personally applicable to the priest. For example, even if the priest is in a nation dangerously close to war with its neighbor, this condition will not appear in the tenor of the moment unless the priest is personally involved (if he's currently in the direct path of an invading army, for instance). One casting of this spell tends to \"taint\" subsequent castings of the same spell unless they are separated by a minimum length of time. If a priest casts this spell twice within 12 hours, the second reading gives the same result as the first, regardless of the actual situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 12 hours of another priest's use of the spell, he receives an accurate reading. The material component is a set of 36 small disks made of polished bone engraved with runes that represent numbers. These disks are not consumed in the casting."

When the weapon is used, it hits and causes damage normally, but the damage is not applied to the creature struck by the weapon. Instead, the person wielding the weapon or one of his companions suffers the damage. If the weapon misses its target on any round, no damage is caused in that round. Using a die roll, the DM randomly determines the victim of the damage. The DM selects a die with a value nearest the number of eligible creatures (the wielder of the weapon and his companions). If the number of creatures does not equate to highest value of a die, the wielder of the enchanted weapon takes the extra chances to be hit. For example, if a goblin wields a sword affected by this spell, he and his six companions are eligible to receive the damage. The DM rolls 1d8. On a roll of 1-6, one of the goblin's companions suffers the damage; on a roll of 7 or 8, the goblin with the affected weapon suffers the damage. The weapon is affected for 3 rounds+1 round/level of the spell caster. If the wielder of the weapon changes weapons while the spell is in effect, the discarded weapon remains enchanted.

The creature affected by rigid thinking is in capable of performing any action other than the activity he is involved in when the spell takes effect. The creature's mind simply cannot decide on another course of action--it becomes frozen into a single thought and cannot change even if new circumstances would suggest otherwise. Thus, a warrior fighting a kobold will ignore the arrival of a beholder, and a thief picking a lock will pay no heed to the arrival of three guards. The affected creature does not mechanically repeat the action; he is not an automaton. He will not continue to fire his bow at a dragon if he runs out of arrows, but will choose another means of attacking the dragon to the exclusion of all other activities. A spellcaster in the process of casting a spell when rigid thinking takes effect will not attempt to repeat the spell (unless the spell has been memorized more than once). The spellcaster will, however, devote his attention to the target of that spell until his goal is met (e.g., if the caster were attacking a creature, he would continue to direct attacks at that creature; if the caster were trying to open a door, he would continue to work on the door until it opens). The spell expires when the creature accomplishes his goal (i.e., the kobold is killed or the lock is opened) or when the duration of the spell has ended."

The characters can be a mixed group of Lawful Neutral, Lawful Good, or Lawful Evil alignments. The spell will not take effect if any creature of Neutral or Chaotic alignment is included in the group. Prior to casting, one creature is designated the keystone. There may never be more than one keystone in a group, even if another creature has equal strength. Upon completion of the spell, all affected characters gain a bonus to damage equal to the keystone's bonus to damage from Strength. Any magical bonuses belonging to the keystone are not added; only the keystone's natural strength is conferred on the group. This bonus supersedes any bonus a character might normally receive. Thus, a warrior with 16 Strength (a +1 bonus to damage) who benefits from this spell with a keystone who has Strength 18/07 (a damage bonus of +3) gains a total bonus of +3 to damage (not +4 to damage). The keystone receives no bonus. Affected creatures gain no improvements to THAC0, bend bars/lift gates, or other functions of Strength.

While the spell is in effect, the two participants can communicate silently and rapidly, regardless of whether they share a common language. Telepathy does not give either participant access to the other's thoughts, memories, or emotions. Participants can only \"hear\" the thoughts that the other participant actively \"sends.\" Mind-to-mind communication is approximately four times faster than verbal communication. The level of complexity that can be communicated is only that which can be expressed through language. Gestures, expressions, and body language cannot be conveyed. A priest can establish separate \"telepathic channels\" to multiple individuals. Each linkage is established through a separate casting of the spell. There is no network between the channels. For example, Balfas the priest establishes telepathy with Alra the warrior and Zymor the thief by casting this spell twice. Balfas can communicate a single thought to both Alra and Zymor, but Alra and Zymor cannot communicate with each other. Balfas, however, can \"target\" a thought so that only one of the two participants receives it. If the priest casts this spell on an unwilling subject (for example, if the priest wants to silently threaten or taunt the subject), the subject receives a saving throw vs. spell to resist the effect. Willing subjects need not make a saving throw. Lead sheeting of more than ½ \" thickness will totally block telepathy."

    "Description": "This spell requires the priest to perform a numerological analysis of a subject's correct name. The result is that the priest may cast another spell that affects the subject individual at a range much greater than normal. In other words, by gaining deep knowledge of the individual, the priest creates a \"channel\" to that individual that makes a subsequent spell easier to cast on that subject. Only certain spells can benefit from telethaumaturgy: bless* command charm person or mammal detect charm hold person know alignment remove curse* probability control quest confusion (one creature only) exaction For spells marked with an asterisk (*), telethaumaturgy also increases the range of the reversed spell. Unless indicated, telethaumaturgy does not increase the range of the reversed spells. The increase in range depends on the level of the priest casting telethaumaturgy: Level Range Multiplier 1-6 x2 7-11 x3 12-16 x4 17+ x5 Thus, a 12th-level priest who has cast telethaumaturgy on an individual could subsequently cast charm person on that individual at a range of 320 yards, rather than the normal range of 80 yards. A spell to be enhanced by telethaumaturgy must be cast on the round immediately following the completion of telethaumaturgy. Spells that normally affect more than one individual (such as confusion ) will affect only the selected subject when cast following telethaumaturgy. When telethaumaturgy is cast by a priest of 11th level or higher, it has an additional effect. If the target is within the normal range of the subsequent spell (e.g., 80 yards for charm person), the subject's saving throw suffers a penalty of -2. Like the personal reading spell, telethaumaturgy functions only if the priest knows the correct name of his subject. If the priest casts the spell using an alias, he will not know that telethaumaturgy has not taken effect until the subsequent spell fails. The priest does not automatically know why the subsequent spell failed (the subject might simply have made a successful saving throw).

    "Description": "When a cleric employs this spell, he or she touches a subject who is injured, unconscious and \"at death's door\" (-1 to -9 hit points). The spell immediately brings the wounded individual back up to 0 hit points, bringing the subject back from death's door. Although the victim remains unconscious, bleeding anddeterioration are stopped for the duration of the spell. The subject (now at 0 hit points) can be brought immediately to consciousness by clerical spells or items that restore lost hit points. The DM should modify this spell if he or she disallows the optional rule for \"hovering on death's door\" (page 75 of the DMG). If the DM considers characters to be immediately dead once they reach 0 hit points, then this spell may bring mortally wounded (0 to -9 hit points) characters back to life, providing it is cast within 1-10 rounds of the victim's demise. The subject must make a system shock roll to survive the transition, and if successful, he or she permanently loses a point of Constitution. This modified version restores the victim to 1 hit point, which may now be immediately increased by further magical healing, as outlined above. Once too much time elapses after an individual's death, the victim can only be brought back to life with a raise dead spell or some other, more powerful form of necromancy. The material components of the spell are the cleric's holy/unholy symbol, a bit of white linen, and any form of unguent."

    "Description": "By casting this spell and touching another individual, a priest may fortify another's life force at the expense of a victim. This spell enables the priest to drain 1-8 hit points plus 1 hp per level of the caster from a living creature. The priest may immediately bestow the hit points on him- or herself, or transfer them to another individual within 1-4 rounds of the casting. The stolen hit points can increase those of the recipient beyond the normal maximum, and these extra hit points only last for up to one turn per the caster's level. Any damage suffered by the subject is first subtracted from these additional hit points. Though predominantly employed by evil priests at the expense of innocents, the spell may be used by those of noble intent, but only if all participants act of their own accord. However, if the victim (the donor of the life force) is unwilling, a saving throw indicates that the spell was partially resisted and only half the hit points were drained. Undead can neither benefit nor be harmed by life draining. It is possible, however, for an undead priest to drain hit points from a victim and bestow them on a living ally"

    "Description": "When cast near the corpse of a newly dead individual, this spell binds an individual's life force to its physical remains, preventing a spirit's departure to the afterlife. The (presumably unwilling) spirit of the deceased is entitled to a saving throw vs. spells to resist the effect (made as if still alive), modified by a -1 penalty for every three levels of experience past the 1st of the priest (-2 penalty at 7th level, -3 at 10th level, to a maximum of -6 at 19th level). Spirit bind must be cast on the body of the deceased within one round of the individuals' death, for every level of experience of the caster. Thus a 10th-level priest may bind the spirit of an individual who was dead for up to a turn. If successful, the spirit bound corpse takes on a pale silvery or mauve radiance. Normal animals and even monsters of low intelligence will involuntarily shun this necromantic aura. While under the effect of this spell, a cadaver becomes immune to the normal effects of rot and decay. Spirit bind may thus be employed to preserve a body for a subsequent raising or resurrection, for which the spirit bound individual is considered to have been dead for less than a day. Furthermore, because of the strong, necromantic link already forged between the spirit and the body, the victim receives a -10% bonus on his or her system shock roll. However, this spell is more often put to much darker ends by death priests. Note that, for the deceased, being spirit bound is not a pleasant experience. The spirit may not be aware of its current location or the passage of time (or so good-aligned priests who employ this spell may like to think), but it is most certainly aware of being trapped or constrained. Once bound to its body, a spirit is much easier to coerce with threats of permanent imprisonment and to interrogate with speak with dead spells. Some sages speculate spirit bind may be also involved in the loathsome creation of a flesh golem. While immune to normal decay and dissolution (and the ravaging of animals and dumb monsters), the spirit bound corpse is in no way protected from destruction by a sentient creature or individual. Should its body be destroyed, the spirit instead becomes bound to the last area resided by the physical remains. Such a restless, quasi-liberated spirit might become a non-corporeal undead (such as an apparition, banshee, haunt, poltergeist, wraith, ghost, or spectre). A spirit imprisoned in this manner may only be released by casting the reverse of this spell (see below) or dispel evil (dispel magic and reverse curse arc ineffective). Because of the considerable dangers for the subject and moral quandaries involved, good-aligned priests arc naturally reluctant to employ spirit bind except in the most dire emergencies. The reverse of this spell, spirit release, severs a spirits ties with the material world and is a common practice at formal funerals. Unwilling, non-corporeal undead are entitled to a saving throw to resist the spell's effects, subject to the same penalties as outlined for spirit bind. If failed, the undead spirit departs for the outer planes and is effectively dispersed. Note that neither version of this spell affects corporeal undead (such as ghouls, liches, and vampires), nor do they affect extraplanar creatures."

The spell fails against entities of demigod status or greater, but their servants or minions can be abjured. If the creature has a specific (proper) name, it must be known and used. Any magic resistance of the subject must be overcome, or the spell fails. The priest has a 50% chance of success (a roll of 11 or better on 1d20). The roll is adjusted by the difference in level or Hit Dice between the caster and the creature being abjured; the number needed is decreased if the priest has more Hit Dice and increased if the creature has more Hit Dice. If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly hurled back to its own plane. The affected creature must survive a system shock check. If the creature does not have a Constitution score, the required roll is 70% + 2%/Hit Die or level. The caster has no control over where in the creature's plane the abjured creature arrives. If the attempt fails, the priest must gain another level before another attempt can be made on that particular creature. The spell requires the priest's holy symbol, holy water, and some material inimical to the creature."

Naturally, this spell works only outdoors, but not necessarily only in wooded areas. The caster begins the incantation and continues uninterrupted until some called creature appears or two turns have elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic gesturing are easy, so this is not particularly exhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type of the following sorts of beings can be summoned by the spell. They come only if they are within the range of the call. The caster can call three times, for a different type each time. Once a call is successful, no other type can be called without another casting of the spell. (The DM will consult his outdoor map or base the probability of any such creature being within spell range upon the nature of the area the caster is in at the time of spellcasting.) The creature(s) called by the spell are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a -4 penalty) to avoid the summons. Any woodland beings answering the call are favorably disposed to the spellcaster and give whatever aid they are capable of. However, if the caller or members of the caller's party are of evil alignment, the creatures are entitled to another saving throw vs. spell (this time with a +4 bonus) when they come within 10 yards of the caster or another evil character with him. These beings immediately seek to escape if their saving throws are successful. In any event, if the caster requests that the summoned creatures engage in combat on his behalf, they are required to roll a loyalty reaction check based on the caster's Charisma and whatever dealings he has had with them. This spell works with respect to neutral or good woodland creatures, as determined by the DM. Thus, the DM can freely add to or alter the list as he sees fit. If the caster personally knows a certain individual woodland being, that being can be summoned at double the normal range. If this is done, no other woodland creatures are affected. If a percentage chance is given in the accompanying table, druids and other nature- based priests add 1% per caster level. These chances can be used if no other campaign information on the area is available. The material components of this spell are a pine cone and eight holly berries.

The spellcan be used to ensure the comfort of the caster and those with him in extreme weather conditions. The party could stand about in shirt sleeves during the worst blizzard (although it would be raining on them) or make ice for their drinks during a scorching heat wave. The spell also provides protection from intense normal and magical attacks. If the extreme of temperature is beyond what could be affected by the spell (a searing blast of a fireball or the icy chill of a white dragon), the spell reduces the damage caused by 5 points for every level of the caster. Normal saving throws are still allowed, and the reduction is taken after the saving throw is made or failed. Once struck by such an attack, the spell immediately collapses.

This can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the augury spell, this gives a specific piece of advice. For example, if the question is \"Will we do well if we venture to the third level?\" and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (the DM estimates the party could beat the troll after a hard fight), the divination response might be: \"Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.\" In all cases, the DM controls what information is received and whether additional divinations will supply additional information. Note that if the information is not acted upon, the conditions probably change so that the information is no longer useful (in the example, the troll might move away and take the treasure with it). The base chance for a correct divination is 60%, plus 1% for each experience level of the priest casting the spell. The DM makes adjustments to this base chance considering the actions being divined (if, for example, unusual precautions against the spell have been taken). If the dice roll is failed, the caster knows the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work. The material components of the divination spell are a sacrificial offering, incense, and the holy symbol of the priest. If an unusually important divination is attempted, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems, jewelry, or magical items may be required."

Only one type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e., a single casting cannot affect both an ant and a fly) and all insects affected must be grown to the same size. The number of insects and the size to which they can be grown depends upon the priest's level: Priest's Insect Maximum Level Hit Dice Total HD 7-9 3 9 10-12 4 12 13+ 6 15 For example, an 8th-level priest can grow three insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2 Hit Dice, or nine insects to 1 Hit Die. Flying insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a rider of human size (assume that such can carry 80 pounds per Hit Die). If the casting is interrupted for any reason, or if the insects are currently subject to any other magical effect (including this one), the insects die and the spell is ruined. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are available; this is often a greater limitation on the spell than the limits above. If the insect created by this spell matches an existing monster description, use the monster description. Otherwise, unless the DM creates a special description, the giant form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 4, one attack, and inflicts 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die. For example, a 14th-level priest uses the giant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 points of damage. Note that the spell works only on actual insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other types of small creatures are not affected. Any giant insects created by this spell do not attempt to harm the priest, but the priest's control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (\"attack,\" \"defend,\" \"guard,\" and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex. Unlesscommanded to do otherwise, the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is near them. The reverse of the spell, shrink insect, reduces any giant insect to normal insect size. The number of Hit Dice affected by the priest is subtracted from the number of Hit Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial shrinking is ignored; an insect is either shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level priest attacked by giant ants could shrink three warrior ants or four worker ants to normal insect size with no saving throw. This spell has no effect on intelligent insectlike creatures. The priest must use his holy symbol for either version of the spell."

In addition, the person thus imbued must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher. Only priest spells of an informational or defensive nature or a cure light wounds spell can be transferred.

Higher level persons can receive more than one spell at the priest's option: Level of Recipient Spells Imbued 1 One 1st-level spell 3 Two 1st-level spells 5+ Two 1st- and one 2nd-level spells The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area of effect, etc.) function according to the level of the priest originally imbuing the spell. A priest who casts imbue with spell ability upon another character loses the number of 1st- and 2nd-level spells he has imbued until the recipient uses the transferred spells or is slain. For example, a 7th-level priest with five 1st- and four 2nd-level spells imbues a 10th-level fighter with a cure light wounds spell and a slow poison spell. The cleric now can have only four 1st-level spells memorized until the cure is cast and only three 2nd- level spells until the slow poison is cast, or until the fighter is killed.

The depth can be lowered by up to 2 feet for every experience level of the priest. The water is lowered within a square area whose sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus, an 8th-level priest affects a volume up to 16 feet x 80 feet x 80 feet, a 9th-level caster affects a volume up to 18 feet x 90 feet x 90 feet, and so on.

Note that an opponent, such as a poisonous reptile or snake (or even an envenomed weapon of an opponent) unwilling to be so touched requires the priest to roll a successful attack in combat. This spell can prevent death in a poisoned creature if cast before death occurs. The effects of the spell are permanent only with respect to poison existing in the touched creature at the time of the touch; thus, creatures (and objects) that generate new poison are not permanently detoxified. The reversed spell, poison, likewise requires a successful attack roll, and the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. poison. If the latter is unsuccessful, the victim is incapacitated"

    "Description": "The plant door spell opens a magical portal or passageway through trees, undergrowth, thickets, or any similar growth--even growth of a magical nature. The plant door is open to the caster who cast the spell, casters of a higher level, or dryads; others must be shown the location of the door. The door even enables the caster to enter a solid tree trunk and remain hidden there until the spell ends. The spell also enables the passage or hiding of any man-sized or smaller creature; hiding is subject to space considerations. If the tree is cut down or burned, those within must leave before the tree falls or is consumed, or else they are killed also. The duration of the spell is one turn per level of experience of the caster. If the caster opts to stay within an oak, the spell lasts nine times longer than normal; if within an ash tree, it lasts three times longer. The path created by the spell is up to 4 feet wide, 8 feet high, and 12 feet long per level of experience of the caster. This spell does not function on plant-based monsters (shambling mounds, molds, slimes, treants, etc.). The material components for this spell are a piece of charcoal and the caster's holy symbol."

The pool can be of no greater diameter than 2 feet per level of the caster. The effect is to create a scrying device similar to a crystal ball. The scrying can extend only to the Ethereal Plane and the Inner Planes (which includes the paraelemental planes, the Demiplane of Shadow, etc.). General notes on scrying, detection by the subject, and penalties for attempting to scry beyond the caster's own plane are given in the DMG, as well as a description of the crystal ball item. The following spells can be cast through a reflecting pool, with a 5% per level chance for operating correctly: detect magic, detect snares and pits, and detect poison. Each additional detection attempt requires a round of concentration, regardless of success. Infravision, if available, operates normally through the reflecting pool. The image is nearly always hazy enough to prevent the reading of script of any type. The material component is the oil extracted from such nuts as the hickory and the walnut, refined, and dropped in three measures upon the surface of the pool. (A measure need be no more than a single ounce of oil.) At the DM's option, the casting of this spell may be limited to once per day."

Thus, the caster can question plants as to whether or not creatures have passed through them, cause thickets to part to enable easy passage, require vines to entangle pursuers, and command similar services. The spell does not enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but any movements within the plants' normal capabilities are possible.

The spell has several additional limitations. First, the caster must have directly experienced the effect of the specified spell. For example, if the caster has been attacked by a fireball spell at some time, he can use the spell immunity spell to provide protection from a fireball. Second, the spell cannot affect a creature already magically protected by a potion, protective spell, ring, or other device. Third, only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain sphere of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect; thus, a creature given immunity to the lightning bolt spell is still vulnerable to a shocking grasp spell.

    "Description": "By means of this spell, the caster can change 1d4 sticks, plus one stick per experience level, into snakes; thus, a 9th-level priest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal number of snakes. These snakes attack as commanded by the priest. There must, of course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood (such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into snakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a staff. Sticks held by creatures are allowed a saving throw equal to that of the possessor (i.e., a spear held by an orc must roll the orc's saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical items, such as staves and enchanted spears, are not affected by the spell. Only sticks within the area of effect are changed. The type of snake created varies, but a typical specimen has 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 6, a movement rate of 9, and either constricts for 1d4+1 points of damage per round or bites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The chance of a snake thus changed being venomous is 5% per caster level, if the spellcaster desires. Thus, an 11th-level priest has a maximum 55% chance that any snake created by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts for two rounds for each experience level of the spellcaster. The material components of the spell are a small piece of bark and several snake scales. The reverse spell changes normal-sized snakes to sticks for the same duration, or it negates the sticks to snakes spell according to the level of the priest countering the spell (for example, a 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell can turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks)."

    "Description": "An improved version of the fortify spell, entrench has much the same effect, but prepares an even more formidable set of defenses. Like fortify, entrench may be used to prepare an open outdoors area such as a field or grassland, or a rough outdoors area such as a hillside or forest. Large rooms or chambers may be entrenched as well. In addition to the ditches and ramparts of the fortify spell, entrench makes use of local materials to create a small palisade and an array of stakes or sharp stones to discourage attackers. A. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth faced by a staked ditch rises from the ground along the perimeter of the site. Creatures defending the dike receive 75% cover against missile fire (+7 bonus to AC), or 25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing missiles out of the dike. Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the rampart, and must spend one full round negotiating the defenses in order to attack. The dike’s defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls against any creatures trying to move through the stakes or stones. B. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones, deadwood, and briars are arranged to form a defensible wall along the perimeter of the area of effect, faced by an array of sharp stakes or stones. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 90% cover (+10 bonus to AC), or 50% cover (+4 bonus) if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. Attacking creatures cannot run, charge, or sprint through the defenses, and must spend one full round to get through the stakes plus an additional round climbing over the wall in order to enter the fortified area. The wall’s defenders gain a +1 bonus to attacks against creatures negotiating the defenses. C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In swamps or bogs, entrench creates a water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 15 feet wide and 3 to 6 feet deep; most creatures require two full rounds to negotiate the ditch and climb up the far side, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up the other side. The fortifications created by this spell are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and clearing or filling can return the site to its original state. The material component is the shell of a giant nautilus. In the Battlesystem rules, entrench provides the defending units with a +3 bonus to their AR versus missile and melee attacks, but only a +1 bonus against missile attacks in marshy areas."

In addition, the caster has a chance of piercing magical illusions, blending, and invisibility equal to 70% plus 1% per level of experience, less 2% per spell level. For example, a 7th-level priest has a 70% + 7% - 4%, or 73% chance, to spot a wizard concealing himself by using the 2nd-level spell invisibility. Unlike the 5th-level spell true seeing, the omniscient eye does not grant the caster the ability to perceive secret doors, traps, lost or misplaced objects, or creature alignments; it simply ensures that the caster can see the surroundings as they would appear without the interference of weather, lighting, or illusionary magic. Thus, the omniscient eye can be deceived by careful camouflage, concealment, or other purely physical precautions. Other phenomena that may bypass this spell’s power include psionic invisibility, true transparency, or extradimensional objects or creatures.

    "Description": "By using this spell, the caster can place one willing subject in a state of suspended animation. The victim’s breathing, heartbeat, and other vital processes slow to the point of nonexistence, although he or she seems to be deeply asleep, not dead. A caster of 7th to 10th level can maintain the suspended animation for up to one week plus one day per level; a caster of 11th to 15th level can maintain the state for up to one month plus one week per level; and a caster of 16th level or higher can place someone in suspended animation for one year plus one month per level. This spell has many useful applications. First, all bodily or mental afflictions become quiescent during the victim’s slumber. Poison, insanity, and many curses (lycanthropy, geas, and mummy rot included) can be arrested, if not cured, and have no effect on the subject while he sleeps. Of course, if the spell is broken prematurely, all the conditions that were halted by the spell will start once again. Second, the subject requires no food or water, but he still needs air and dies if deprived of oxygen. Third, for every month that the subject is in suspended animation, he recovers one hit point. The caster can awaken the subject at any time within the spell’s duration, although he must be in the subject’s presence to do so. Optionally, the priest may pre-specify an amount of time within his normal duration or a special condition to awaken the sleeper. A condition must include a physical stimulus to the subject, such as a change in temperature, the touch of the sun, the kiss of a princess, or whatever the priest desires. If the priest maintaining the spell dies or is not able to awaken the sleeper, then the subject can be taken to another priest of the same deity to be awakened. If the subject is attacked, he is completely helpless and can be killed by a single blow. However, if the subject is attacked without being slain for some reason, he gains a saving throw vs. spell each round to emerge from his suspended animation. The subject will be extremely groggy and disoriented if his slumber is disturbed in this fashion, suffering a –2 penalty to all die rolls for 1d6 turns, but if he awakens in the normal or prescribed fashion, he is disoriented for only one round. Some of the drawbacks to this spell affect the casting priest. First of all, it takes all of the priest’s concentration to cast and maintain this spell. This means that the priest cannot cast any other spell while a subject is being held under the influence of the suspended animation. For each week that the subject is in suspended animation, the priest loses one point of Constitution. This happens each week until the priest transfers the spell to another priest of the same alignment. Transferring this spell requires a successful saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, then the priest who transfers the spell can start recovering Constitution at a rate of one point per hour of bedrest. If the saving throw doesn’t succeed, then the priest loses another point of Constitution and cannot try to transfer the spell again for 8 hours. Either way, because of the temporary lapse of the spell, the subject will automatically lose 1 hit point each time a transfer is attempted. The material component for this spell is a rare herb that must be prepared with exacting care. The treatment costs at least 200 gold pieces and requires 1d3 days of the priest’s time and attention."

If used from a high place such as a mountainside or tower, the caster can glide a maximum horizontal distance of 20 feet per foot of initial altitude—for example, if the priest used this spell and launched himself from a hilltop 800 feet high, he could glide a maximum distance of 16,000 feet, or about 3 miles. If windborne is cast by a priest on level ground, the initial gust carries him aloft to a maximum altitude of 10 feet per caster level. From that point, he may then glide 10 feet per foot of initial altitude. For example, a 7th-level priest would ascend to an altitude of 70 feet and thus be able to glide for a total horizontal distance of 700 feet. He can choose to glide for a much shorter distance, but never less than his initial altitude. While gliding, the priest moves at a rate of 15 (or about 450 feet) with a maneuverability class of D. Each round, he drops between 20 and 40 feet. He can choose to descend at a much more rapid pace, dropping up to 200 feet per round without risk of a damaging impact upon landing.

The spell gives the priest only rudimentary control over the creation process, so the object cannot be complex. The object must be described in a single word or short phrase (e.g., \"a water pitcher\" or \"a block of stone\"). The caster has no control over elements such as shape or color; thus, the water pitcher might be short, squat, and blue, or tall, slender, and red. Objects created with this spell cannot be of any greater mechanical complexity or technological level than a crossbow. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, the spell fails and nothing is created. Thus, if the priest tried to create \"a pistol,\" assuming he had heard the word somewhere, the spell would fail. Objects cannot contain any information in an abstract form such as writing or diagrams. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, there are two possible results: the spell may fail, or the object may be created without the information. Thus, if the priest were to attempt to create \"a spellbook,\" the result would be either a book similar to a spellbook with blank pages, or nothing at all. The object appears at whatever location the caster wills, as long as it is within spell range. The object cannot appear in the same space occupied by another object or creature, or within a hollow object (for example, the priest cannot create an object blocking the trachea of an enemy). The object created by addition remains in existence for 1 turn per level of the caster. During this time, it obeys all the laws of physics as if it were a \"real\" object. The object cannot be disbelieved and spells such as true seeing cannot distinguish it from a naturally-occurring object. Priests of 11th to 15th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 20 pounds in mass or two identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) so created remains in existence for two hours (12 turns) per level of the caster. Priests of 16th to 19th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 50 pounds in mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) is permanent unless destroyed. Since these objects are not magical constructs, but real additions to the \"equation of the moment,\" dispel magic has no effect on them. Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal (nonmonstrous) living creature of up to 20 pounds in weight. The creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its species; the caster has no control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 5 rounds per level of the caster. Priests of 20th level and above can create a single inanimate object of up to 100 pounds in mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to 10 pounds in mass. The object(s) are permanent. Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal (nonmonstrous) living creature of up to 100 pounds in weight and up to 2 hit dice. The creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its species; the caster has no control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 2 turns per level of the caster. The material component is a small table of numerological formulae inscribed on an ivory plaque, plus a length of silken cord. During the casting, the priest ties the cord into a complex knot. As the magical energy is discharged, the cord vanishes in a flash of light. The plaque is not consumed in the casting."

The change in age, either forward or backward, is chosen by the priest at the time of casting. The changes associated with normal or reversed growth occur instantaneously. Plants can be altered in age up to 10 years per level of the caster. The caster can stop the aging at any point within the limits imposed by his level; he could cause a tree to grow from a sapling until it withers and dies from old age or he could stop the tree's growth at a stage at which it would shelter his home. The spell does not alter the appearance or characteristics of a plant except those that result from normal aging (or regression).

However, wizards are not able to memorize spells; \"real\" time must pass for this to occur. • The subject's need to breathe is reduced. He breathes only 10% as often as normal for the duration of the spell, enabling him to hold his breath 10 times longer than normal and use less air in enclosed situations. • The subject can set an internal \"alarm clock\" to alert him when a specific amount of time has passed. The subject then hears a brief ringing in his ears, audible only to him. The ringing is loud enough to wake the subject. He can set as many internal alarm clocks as he wishes, as long as they all occur within the duration of the spell. The spell has no effect on movement, spellcasting, or any other normal activities.

The spell affects only warriors. Unfortunately, these insights are helpful in only two-thirds of the warrior's attacks. In the remaining attacks, the spell actually impairs the warrior's standard performance. At the beginning of each round, after the player has declared his character's actions, 1d6 is rolled for the affected warrior. On a roll of 1, 2, 3, or 4, the warrior gains bonuses of +2 to attack rolls and +2 to armor class. On a roll of 5 or 6, the warrior suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a -2 penalty to armor class. This must be determined at the beginning of the round so that both the warrior and his opponents can apply the necessary changes. The insight imparted by this spell is lost after the spell expires. The insight is generated by chaos, which is nearly impossible to contain. After the spell expires, the warrior remembers the battle but not the specifics of his actions.

    "Description": "After casting this spell, the priest must successfully touch his victim. The victim is then allowed a saving throw to avoid the spell's effect. If the saving throw is failed, the spell takes effect at the next sunrise or sunset (whichever comes first). From the time the spell takes effect until the spell is negated, the sleeping pattern of the victim is randomly disrupted. At sunset and sunrise of every day, a check is made to determine the effects of chaotic sleep. In the 12-hour period that follows the check, there is an equal chance that the character will be unable to sleep or unable to remain awake (roll 1d6; on a roll of 1-3, the character is awake, on a roll of 4-6, he sleeps). This condition lasts until the next sunrise (or sunset) when the check is made again. For example, a fighter fails to save against chaotic sleep. For the next few hours, the spell has no effect. At sundown, the first check is made, resulting in a 2. The fighter does not notice anything until he tries to sleep that night, at which time he is wide awake, fidgeting and restless. At sunrise, another die roll is made, resulting in a 6. The fighter is suddenly exhausted and sleeps until sunset. Characters who sleep as a result of this spell can be roused only by physical stimuli--a slap or a wound, for example. Once awake, the character remains conscious only as long as there are active stimuli around him, such as a fight. Walking through caves or riding a horse will not keep the character awake. Unlike a sleep spell, characters affected by chaotic sleep doze off as soon as they are left relatively undisturbed. Keeping an affected character awake is difficult at best. Lack of sleep will eventually take a physical toll on any character under the influence of the spell. For every 12-hour period that a character remains awake beyond the first, he suffers a -1 penalty to THAC0. Such characters do not regain hit points as a result of normal healing. Spellcasters cannot memorize spells until they have had sufficient sleep. Chaotic sleep can be removed with a remove curse. The material components are a pinch of sand and three coffee beans."

If he discovers treasure, he divides it into tidy piles or containers of silver, gold, and copper. He is reluctant to enter a dungeon because it is a messy place, but once inside, he is obsessed with cleaning it. A character under the power of this spell will sweep dirt from dungeon corridors into neat piles, arrange the corpses of a defeated orc band according to size, dash forward to remove a bit of lint on clothing, and insist that the party organize themselves alphabetically, then by size, and then by age. While the spell does not affect a character's abilities, the overwhelming desire for order impairs the character's usefulness in most adventures. When a character afflicted by this spell attempts to undertake a new event (begin a battle, haggle with the merchant, etc.), the player must rationalize the action on the basis of his compulsion for order. Thus, the character cannot simply attack a goblin; he must announce a condition such as attacking the tallest goblin and fighting his way down according to size. Once stated, the character must follow through with this plan. If the player cannot conceive a rationale for his character's behavior, the character is forced to delay his actions for 1d6 rounds, with the time spent in preparation for the subsequent action. The character spends time arranging spell components artistically, deciding how to hold his sword, cleaning his weapon, etc. Anyone affected by compulsive order may become violent if he is prevented from being neat. He will do what he must to make the world around him more orderly. If he is allowed to organize his surroundings, he will quickly calm down again. The victim will constantly petition the people around him to be neat and organized. The victim is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects of the spell. Compulsive order can be removed with a dispel magic spell. The material component is a perfect cube made of metal."

    "Description": "This spell must be cast on at least two creatures. The priest may affect one creature per two levels of his experience, and all creatures to be affected must be within three feet of each other at the time of casting. After the spell is completed, affected characters may move about freely. Defensive harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an enhanced coordination of their attacks and defenses. The affected creatures must be involved in a single battle so that their efforts harmonize to the benefit of all involved. For example, the affected creatures can attack one dragon or a group of orcs in a single area. They can also attack additional enemy forces that arrive in the same combat. If the enemy forces divide and flee, the affected creatures can follow, continue to attack, and benefit from the spell. If the affected group is split into two smaller groups when attacked, however, it gains no benefit from defensive harmony. While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +1 bonus to armor class for every other creature benefitting from the spell, to a maximum bonus of +5 (although more than five characters may be affected by the spell). Thus, if four creatures are affected by defensive harmony, each creature gains a +3 bonus to armor class. This bonus represents a mystical coordination of effort on the part of all affected creatures. A fighter will naturally wage his attack to distract the troll attacking the thief. The ranger will instinctively block the swing of an orc, thereby protecting the wizard. Creatures affected by the spell are not consciously aware of these efforts, and they are unable to create specific strategies and tactics."

    "CastingTime": "1 round",
    "Duration": "1 round",
    "Description": "This spell allows the caster to selectively warp the fabric of space, folding it into higher dimensions. This effect can be best explained through an example. If an ant crawling along the west edge of a map decided to travel to the east edge of the map, it would have to crawl the full width of the map. But if the map were folded in two so that the east and west edges were touching, the ant would travel almost no distance at all. The ant's world (the map) would have been folded through the third dimension. The dimensional folding spell does something similar with the three-dimensional world: it folds it through a higher dimension (the fourth), allowing instantaneous travel between two locales on the same plane of existence. Although this effect may seem similar to the wizard spell teleport, in practice, it is much different. The dimensional folding spell opens a gate that allows instantaneous, bidirectional access to a distant locale on the same plane. This gate is circular, of any size up to 10' in diameter, and remains in existence for up to 1 full round. The caster and any other creatures can pass through the gate in either direction while it remains open. Missile weapons and magic spells can also pass through the gate. The gate appears as a shimmering ring, glowing with a faint light equivalent to starshine. Vision through the gate is clear and unobstructed in both directions, allowing the priest to \"look before he leaps.\" However, anyone on the other side of the gate is able to see the priest and his point of origin. The \"near side\" of the gate always appears within 5 feet of the priest. The location of the \"far side\" of the gate always opens within 5 feet of the place the priest desires. Thus, there is no chance of arriving at the wrong destination, as with the wizard spell teleport. There is a risk involved in using dimensional folding, however. Many philosophers believe that what we know as time is simply another dimension, and the behavior of this spell seems to support this thesis. Unless the priest is extremely familiar with the destination, there is a significant chance that any creature passing through a dimensional folding gate will suffer instantaneous aging. Theorists believe that this is the same kind of \"slippage\" that can cause a teleporting wizard to land high or low, except that in this case, the slippage is in the time dimension. The chance of this instantaneous aging occurring depends on how familiar the priest is with the destination. The table that follows outlines the conditions and effects of aging. Chance of Amount of Destination is: aging aging Very familiar* 2% 1 year Studied carefully 5% 1d2 years Seen casually 10% 1d3 years Viewed once 15% 1d6 years Never seen 25% 1d10 years * Use this row if the desired location is within view of the priest. If the die roll indicates that aging occurs, every creature that passes through the gate in either direction suffers the aging effect. Multiple creatures passing through the gate in the same direction all age by the same amount determined by a single die roll. Although the chance of aging is low and the potential amount of aging is minimal for familiar destinations, the effects can add up and become significant over time. Although the word \"destination\" is used to refer to the \"far end\" of the gate, the priest need not be the one doing the traveling. For example, a priest may open the gate near a distant ally so he may travel instantaneously to join the priest. The material component is a sheet of platinum \"tissue\" worth at least 15 gp, which the priest folds intricately during the casting. The tissue is consumed when the gate closes."

Fire purge has no effect on fires that are within the area of effect when the spell is cast, (i.e., it does not extinguish existing fires). The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a scorched sliver of wood. Fire purge can be cast as cooperative magic. If a number of priests cast this spell simultaneously, its effectiveness is significantly increased.

    "Description": "This spell creates the necessary conditions for devotional energy to be used. For faith magic to work, the priest must create a focus to harness the necessary devotional energy. This spell creates that focus. A focus cannot function without a source of devotional energy. The focus gathers devotional energy and reshapes it in order to amplify other spells cast by the priest (or priests). The same energy keeps the focus in existence. If the spell is cast and there is no immediate source of devotional energy within 100 feet, the focus immediately fails. Once created, most foci cannot be moved. This condition and the need for a constant supply of devotional energy tends to limit the use of foci to temples, churches, monasteries, shrines, and seminaries--permanent structures where followers of the religion gather on a regular basis. Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival. Not all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by detect magic. There are three basic types of foci: site, item, and living. Site foci are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible and intangible. Item foci are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical. The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the religion. Living foci are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living plant, animal, or person. Detect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted, although not under the influence of a typical charm spell. The type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects. Casting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions. The duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely. Once the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3. Table 3: FOCUSED SPELL EFFECTS Possible Focus Spell Type Anti-animal shell S/I/L Anti-plant shell S/I/L Bless S/I Control temperature, 10' radius S* Control winds S/I* Cure disease I/L Cure blindness or deafness I/L Detect poison S/I Detect lie I Detect magic I Dispel evil S/I Endure cold/endure heat S* Know alignment I/L Negative plane protection S/I Protection from evil S/I Protection from lightning S Protections from fire S Purify food and drink I Remove fear S/I/L Remove curse I Repel insects S/I Resist fire/resist cold S Speak with animals S/I/L Tongues S/I True seeing S * The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the spell's normal limitations at the time it is cast. Once the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored. The focus begins to increase these factors of the spell's power. After one day, the amplified spell reaches its full area of effect. Thereafter, it remains over that area until the focus fails. The area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the caster. The spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster, although it can deliberately be created smaller. Within that area of effect, the amplified spell exerts its normal effect. A 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in diameter. The material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters, and other equipment the DM deems appropriate. The cost of these materials is never less than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified. These items are given up as offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be obtained each time the spell is cast."

If someone tried to pay for an item, he would be insulted. If the spell is cast on a shopper in a store, he would find it natural to steal the item, thinking that he is behaving in a proper way. If the spell is cast on a professed thief, he will no longer steal, choosing to pay for his goods instead. Inverted ethics does not cause a creature to actively commit evil deeds (or good deeds). Thus, an affected creature will not go on a shoplifting rampage; he will steal only as the opportunity presents itself. The spell affects one character per level of the caster within a 20' radius. Each target of the spell is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. The material component is a miniature golden balance (i.e., similar to the scales of justice)."

    "Description": "When a priest casts the 7th-level astral spell, he leaves his physical body in suspended animation while his astral body travels. By touching the comatose body and casting join with astral traveler, a priest can cause his own astral body to leave his physical body in suspended animation. His astral body then travels along the silver cord of the originally projected priest. The caster joins the projected priest as if he were part of the original casting of the astral spell; i.e., his own silver cord is connected to the priest's silver cord, and he is dependent upon the originally projected priest. A priest who casts the 7th-level astral spell can project as many as seven other creatures along with himself. However, priests casting join with astral traveler are an exception to this limit. Any number of priests may join another priest in the Astral plane by use of this spell."

    "Description": "This spell can be cast in one of two variations. The first, appropriate for battlefield use, has a range of 240 yards, duration of 1d4+6 turns, and a casting time of 1 turn. The priest can cast the spell on any single individual (a commander or hero) within his line of sight. While under the influence of this spell, the subject's command radius is increased by 50% (round fractions up). The reverse of this variation, doubt, requires the target to make a saving throw vs. spell. If failed, doubt halves the command radius (round fractions down) of the targeted individual for 1d3+4 turns. The material component for this variation is a pinch of steel dust. The second variation must take place in or within 100' of a place of worship officially dedicated to the casting priest's deity. Both the priest and the individual to be affected must be present. The casting time is 5 turns and involves an intricate ritual and many prayers. At the conclusion of the spell, the subject's command radius is doubled. This effect lasts 2d12 hours. The priest can cast either aspect (but not both at once) on himself. No individual can be the subject of more than one casting of this spell at one time, whether different aspects or cast by different priests. If more than one spell is attempted on the individual, only the most recent casting takes effect."

    "Description": "This spell is similar to the wizard spell domination in that it establishes a telepathic link between the priest and the subject through which the priest can control the subject's bodily movements. There are some significant differences between the spells, however. Elves and half-elves have no innate resistance to this spell. Priest and subject need not share a common language. The priest can force the subject into combat, but the subject's attack rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The priest cannot force the subject to cast spells or use any innate magical or magiclike abilities. The priest can force the subject to speak, although the priest cannot inject a full range of emotions into the subject's voice (everything said by the subject is in a monotone). This spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. Thus, the priest cannot see through the subject's eyes. To control the subject, the priest must be within the range of the spell and must be able to see the subject. Breaking either of these conditions causes the spell to terminate immediately. This spell requires a moderate level of concentration by the priest. While maintaining this spell, he can move or enter combat, but cannot cast another spell. If the priest is wounded, rendered unconscious, or killed, the spell immediately terminates. If the priest is 10th level or lower, he or she cannot force the subject to perform particularly delicate actions, such as picking a lock. At 11th level or higher, however, this restriction is removed. The priest could thus force a thief to pick a lock. Any such delicate actions suffer a -15% penalty (or -3 on 1d20) to reflect the \"remote control\" nature of the action. The material component is a mesh of fine threads that the priest loops around the fingertips of one hand and manipulates in the way that a puppeteer controls a puppet."

    "Description": "This spell enables the caster to reach into the subject's mind and modify up to five minutes of his memory in one of the following ways: •Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate charm, suggestion, geas, quest, or similar spells. •Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event he actually experienced. For instance, he could recall every word from a five-minute conversation or every detail from a passage in a book. •Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced. •Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced. Casting the spell takes one round. If the subject fails to save vs. spell, the caster proceeds with the spell by spending up to five minutes visualizing the memory he wishes to modify in the subject. If the caster's concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, the spell is lost. Modified memory will not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if they contradict his natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much he enjoyed drinking poison, will be dismissed by the subject as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. More useful applications of modified memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with the caster (inclining the subject to act favorably toward the caster), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that the caster cheated him in a card game. The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject."

    "Description": "This spell allows the priest to increase or decrease by a small margin the probability of success for one action. This action can be anything that requires a die roll--an attack, a saving throw, an attempt to use thieving skills, an ability check, or even an attempt to successfully teleport on target. The action must be something performed by a single creature. The basic modification is 15% (15 on 1d100 or 3 on 1d20), plus an additional 5% per five levels of the caster. This modification can be either positive or negative, as deemed by the spellcaster. Thus, a 10th-level priest can modify a subject's saving throw or attack roll by +5 or -5, or a thief's \"climb walls\" roll by +25% or -25%. The priest may cast this spell on himself. For a noncombat action such as an attempt to climb a wall, the priest simply casts the spell on the subject immediately before the action is attempted, informing the DM whether the modification is positive or negative. To use this spell in combat, the priest must specify the action to be affected (e.g., the target's next attack roll) and whether the modification will be positive or negative. The spell remains in effect until the subject attempts the specified action or until a number of rounds equal to the caster's level passes. If the latter occurs, the spell ends without effect. Once the spell is cast, the priest does not need to maintain any level of concentration; the spell will function even if the casting priest is killed before the spell takes effect. The subject of the spell has no way of knowing whether any modification made by this spell is positive or negative (or even whether he was the subject of the spell at all). Thus, a lying priest could claim to raise a thief's chance of climbing the wall, while actually lowering it. The thief would be none the wiser. However, an unwilling subject of this spell receives a normal saving throw to negate its effect. The material components are a small cube of a thickened sugar-and-milk mixture and a cubic die of matching size. Both are consumed in the casting."

    "Description": "This spell is a deeper and more intense version of telepathy. It allows the priest to communicate silently and instantly with a single willing subject. Participants may share deeper thoughts than with telepathy, including emotions and memories. Each participant sees, hears, and otherwise senses everything experienced by the other, although such vicarious experiences feel diluted and cannot be mistaken for direct sensations. The participants can quickly share such personal concepts as plans, hopes, and fears, but they cannot share skills or spells. Thus, it is impossible to communicate the procedure for casting a particular spell or for picking a lock. Communication through rapport is approximately 15 times faster than verbal communication. As with telepathy, the priest can establish separate \"channels\" to multiple individuals; each such linkage costs one casting of the spell. There is no \"crosstalk\" between the channels, however. Rapport cannot be used on unwilling subjects."

    "Description": "This unusual spell is similar to phantasmal force and other illusion magic, except that the priest who casts the spell is the only creature who automatically believes the results of the spell. The spell creates the illusion of any object, creature, or force, as long as it is within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect. The illusion is visual and tactile (that is, it can be seen and felt), but no other sensory stimuli are created. Solipsism is the opposite of normal illusions in that anyone other than the caster must make an active effort to believe (rather than dis believe) the illusion. Characters trying to believe the reality of a solipsistic illusion must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon, modified by the magical defense adjustment for Wisdom. A successful save means that the character believes the illusion and it is part of reality for him. A failed save means that the character cannot convince himself of the illusion's reality, and the illusion has no effect on him. A character can make a single attempt to believe each round. Unlike true illusions, the image created by this spell does more than just duplicate reality. The image formed is real for those who believe in it. The illusion has all the normal properties that its form and function allow. Thus, a solipsistic bridge spanning a chasm could be crossed by the priest and those who believed. All others would see the priest apparently walking out onto nothingness. Likewise, a solipsistic giant would cause real damage to those who believed it. The illusion remains in effect for as long as the priest continues to concentrate on it, until the priest is struck in combat, or until he is rendered unconscious. The level of concentration required is not extreme; the priest can move normally and may engage in combat, but is unable to cast any spell while maintaining a solipsistic illusion. Solipsism can create only illusions that are external to the priest. Thus, the priest cannot create an illusion that he is the size of a giant, is unwounded, or has sprouted wings. The material components are a lotus blossom that the priest must swallow and a bit of fleece."

Units allied to the priest are unaffected and movement is made at normal cost; only enemy units suffer the penalty. A variety of effects result from the spell depending on the terrain: grass twists hinderingly around troops' ankles, swamp becomes more viscous, rocks and gravel shift underfoot, etc. The spell affects only units--that is, groups of soldiers moving in regular or irregular formation. The spell does not affect individuals or monsters moving and operating alone. (When using the BATTLESYSTEM™ rules, figures that represent individual heroes are not affected by this spell.) When casting this spell, the priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight to the terrain to be affected. The priest can choose the shape of the area, up to the maximum area of effect. This spell can create only one continuous area of tanglefoot. There is no way of detecting that a particular area is under the influence of this spell simply by looking at the area. Detect magic will reveal that the area is magically affected. The reverse of this spell, selective passage, cuts the movement cost of an area in half (round fractions up) for friendly units. Again, individual heroes and creatures are not affected by this spell (which means that advancing troops must be careful not to leave their leader behind!). The material component is a drop of molasses for tanglefoot, and a pinch of powdered graphite for selective passage."

    "Description": "This spell turns the subject into a \"thought broadcaster.\" For the duration of the spell, everyone within 30 yards of the subject senses the subject's thoughts, making it impossible for him to lie, keep secrets, conceal motives, etc. The subject is not automatically aware that his thoughts are being sensed. Everyone who senses these thoughts, on the other hand, knows their source. This spell causes the broadcast of only surface thoughts and motivations, not memories. There is no need for a common language between broadcaster and receivers; for this purpose, thoughts are considered to be symbolic, not dependent on language. The detail level of the thoughts is insufficient for others to learn specific skills from the subject. Thus, if the subject casts a spell, everyone within range knows what spell is being cast before it takes effect, but no one learns any knowledge about how the spell is cast. If the broadcaster is invisible or hiding in shadows, the broadcast functions normally, and all receivers are aware that someone is in the vicinity whom they cannot see. While receivers cannot pinpoint the broadcaster's location, the broadcaster's thoughts will inevitably reveal his general position (\"Oh no, he's looking right at me,\" etc.). A character hiding in shadows will be automatically detected, while attacks against an invisible broadcaster suffer a -2 penalty, rather than the normal -4. This spell totally negates the chance of surprise by the broadcaster. The subject must have an Intelligence score of 1 or more to become a broadcaster, and must have a \"normal\" mind as understood by PCs. Thoughts that are broadcast can be received only by individuals with Intelligence scores of 3 or better. An unwilling subject receives a normal saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects. A willing subject can waive this saving throw. The material component is small balloon that the priest inflates upon casting. This balloon is consumed in the casting."

The tree steed may be ridden like a normal horse and may be used to carry equipment. The tree steed can carry up to 600 pounds of riders and gear before breaking. If the tree steed breaks under the weight of the riders or gear, the enchantment instantly ends and the tree steed again becomes a normal (although broken) log or plank. The tree steed obeys all of the caster's verbal commands to move, slow, speed up, stop, and turn. It has a movement rate of 12 on land. It can move in the water (Sw 6), floating on the surface and paddling with its legs. The tree steed must remain within 10 yards of the caster in order to move; if the distance between the tree steed and the caster exceeds 10 yards, the tree steed stops until the caster is again within range. The tree steed will not fight for the caster and is incapable of any action other than movement. The tree steed does not become fatigued and does not eat. It has all the vulnerabilities of normal wood, including fire, and can be damaged by both magical and physical attacks. It has AC 8 and 20 hit points.

    "Description": "Uplift bestows increased spellcasting ability on one priest, including additional spells per level and use of spells beyond the caster's normal level. This cooperative spell requires two priests who must spend the day casting this spell. During the casting, the priests must decide which additional spells (of all levels) are desired. Upon completion of the casting, the priests touch palms, and the priest of higher level receives a charge of magical energy. This charge temporarily boosts the level of the priest for spellcasting purposes. The amount of increase is one level per five levels of the lower level caster (fractions rounded up). If both priests are of equal level, the casters must decide who benefits from the spell. The spell grants the priest the spellcasting ability of the new level. It does not improve hit points, attack rolls, or other abilities. If the increase allows more spells per level, the additional spells are instantly placed in the character's memory. A priest is also enabled to cast spells normally beyond his level. Range, duration, area of effect, and other variables are all based on the character's temporary level. The increased effect lasts only 1 turn. At the end of the turn, all additional spells are lost and the character reverts to his normal level. As an example, consider a party with a fallen comrade. The two priests in the party are 7th and 8th level, both unable to cast raise dead. After a night's rest, each priest adds uplift to his memorized spells. After casting the spell, the 8th-level priest suddenly gains the casting abilities of a 10th-level priest, including the ability to cast raise dead. At the end of one turn, the priest's abilities revert to 8th-level. Casting this spell is an arduous task, causing a severe drain on the priests. When the spell expires, the uplifted character suffers 2d6 points of damage from mental exhaustion. This damage cannot be healed by any means until the character has had at least eight hours of rest. The material components are the priests' holy symbols and an offering worth at least 500 gp from each priest."

An area protected by weather stasis is unaffected by temperature variations in the surrounding environment. The spell also acts as a shield against rain, snow, and hail, which cannot enter the protected area. If conditions of precipitation existed in the area of effect when the spell was cast, the identical weather will continue for the duration of the spell. For example, weather stasis is cast in an area where the temperature is 75 F. and no precipitation is falling. Half an hour later, the temperature drops to 60 degrees and rain begins to fall. The protected area remains dry and the temperature stays at 75 degrees. If the spell had been cast while rain was falling in the area of effect, rain would continue to fall for the duration of the spell, even after it stopped raining in the surrounding area. All physical objects other than rain, snow, and hail can pass into the protected area. All creatures and characters can move freely into and out of the area. The spell does not prevent water-based spells or water-based creatures (such as water elementals) from operating in the area. The spell protects against both natural and magically generated weather. Night and day pass normally in the protected area, although temperature variations associated with night and day do not occur. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a drop of rain"

A death priest, for instance, might inflict a victim with an exaggerated fear of dying (requiring the character to make a saving throw vs. paralyzation to avoid the effects of a fear spell whenever he or she encounters a cadaver, human bones, a graveyard, or even an open coffin). Alternatively, the victim might become convinced that all corpses were undead, waiting to rip him or her to shreds. In a combat situation, a death priest will probably choose to quickly neutralize an opponent with an incapacitating form of insanity, such as confusion or feeblemindedness. The insanity is permanent and cannot be dispelled except by casting cure insanity (the reverse), heal, restoration, or wish. The reverse of this spell immediately cures insanity due to most causes (no saving throw). The spell must be administered while the patient is exhibiting insane symptoms. Cure insanity can heal a conscious victim of the effects of hallucinatory spores and repair psychic trauma (resulting from a mindwipe or other psionic assault). The spell also diminishes psychic exhaustion (restoring 5-40 PSPs). It cures madness resulting from spells (such as confusion, chaos, contact other plane, feeblemind, symbol of insanity, and prismatic spray, wall, or sphere) and also heals the insanity caused by certain magical items (such as an elixir of madness or a scarab of insanity). However, the spell will not control aberrant behaviors caused by lycanthropy, undeath, or powerful curses (such as a geas or quest). Finally, at the DM's discretion, cure insanity may temporarily calm the demented behavior of certain extraplanar creatures (such as slaad)."

    "Description": "With this spell, an evil necromancer priest may exert his or her dark will on the still-beating heart of any living victim, provided the target remains in clear view (line of sight) and within the spell's range. After casting the spell, the priest must focus his or her entire concentration on the victim's heart for three rounds, during which time the caster may not cast other spells or engage in melee. The priest may, however, walk, talk, and take ordinary defensive precautions while the spell runs its course through the victim. During the first round of the spell, the victim must make a saving throw vs. death magic with a -2 penalty. This saving throw is modified according to the victim's hit point adjustment due to Constitution (+1 bonus for 15 Con, +2 for 16 Con, and so on; sec page 15 in the PHB for more on this). If the victim makes this first saving throw, the spell fails to take hold of his or her heart and has no further effect. If the victim foils the save, however, then he or she suffers a massive spasm of pain in the chest (similar to that felt in a heart attack), inflicting 1-8 points of damage on the victim and completely incapacitating the individual for one excruciating round. During the second round, the victim is entitled to another saving throw, this time with a -1 penalty (plusany bonuses for Con). As before, if the victim makes the save, the spell ends with no further effect. If failed, however, the victim's chest pain intensifies, as if a searing band of iron were being slowly tightened around the heart. The character experiences severe dizziness, disorientation, and terrible shooting pains in the arms, jaw, and left shoulder. Meanwhile, the victim loses 25% of any remaining hit points, is paralyzed with pain for 2-5 rounds, and immediately loses 2-5 points of Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity. Providing the victim survives the final stage of the spell (see below), these lost points are regained at a rate of 1 point in each these three ability scores per day. On the third round of the spell, the target must make a (third, unmodified) saving throw vs. death magic or suffer a massive heart attack, resulting in immediate death (onset time is 1 round, during which time, the victim is completely incapacitated). Alternatively, a kind DM might decide that the final phase of the spell merely plunges the victim into a deep, death-like coma, lasting 1-4 days and resulting in the permanent loss of 1 point of Constitution. This deadly spell may be thwarted in a number of ways. Successfully casting dispel magic on either the victim or the priest will disrupt the heart blight, as will casting a simple protection from evil spell on the victim or wearing a scarab of protection (this drains a charge, however). Furthermore, the victim may be entitled to repeat a saving throw with a +2 bonus if treated by another character with the healing nonweapon proficiency. Finally, the spell is immediately broken if the victim is transported out of range or removed from the priest's line of sight. Because of its murderous effect, this spell is only granted to wicked priests by the gods of Death, Disease, and Evil."

An air-walking creature is in control of its movement, except when a strong wind is blowing. In this case, the creature gains or loses 10 feet of movement for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control of movement or suffering physical damage. The spell can be placed upon a trained mount, so it can be ridden through the air.

Only animals within range of the caster at the time the spell is cast will come. The caster can try three times to summon three different types of animals. For example, suppose that wild dogs are first summoned to no avail, then hawks are unsuccessfully called, and finally the caster calls for wild horses. The DM determines the chance of a summoned animal type being within range of the spell. The animals summoned aid the caster by whatever means they possess, staying until a fight is over, a specific mission is finished, the caster is safe, he sends them away, etc. Only normal or giant animals can be summoned; fantastic animals or monsters cannot be effected by this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, etc.)."

A character who refuses to accept an atonement is automatically considered to have committed a willful misdeed.

The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. \"I don't know\" is a legitimate answer, as powerful outer planar beings ar not necessarily omniscient. Optionally, the DM may give a single short answer of five words or less. The spell will, at best, provide information to aid character decisions. Entities communed with structure their answers to further their own purposes. It is probable that the DM will limit the use of commune spells to one per adventure, one per week, or even one per month, for the greater powers dislike frequent interruptions. Likewise, if the caster lags, discusses the answers, or goes off to do anything else, the spell immediately ends. The material components necessary for a commune spell are the priest's religious symbol, holy (unholy) water, and incense. If a particularly potent commune is needed, a sacrifice proportionate with the difficulty of obtaining the information is required. If the offering is insufficient, no information or only partial information is gained."

    "Description": "By means of a control winds spell, the caster is able to alter wind force in the area of effect. For every three levels of experience, the caster can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength. Wind strengths are as follows: Wind Force Miles Per Hour Light Breeze 2-7 Moderate Breeze 8-18 Strong Breeze 19-31 Gale 32-54 Storm 55-72 Hurricane 73-176 Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive small flying creatures--those eagle-sized and under--from the skies, severely affect missile accuracy, and make sailing difficult. Winds in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies and cause minor ship damage. Winds in excess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies, uproot small trees, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, and endanger ships. Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force. An \"eye\" of 40-foot radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used underground, if the spell is cast in an area smaller than the area of effect, the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement. For example, if the area of effect is a 360-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease. However, the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind wanes or waxes at the same rate, until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell up to the limits of his own ability."

    "Description": "When this spell is cast by the priest, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm in a thick cloud. In an environment free of normal insects, the spell fails. The insects obscure vision, limiting it to 10 feet. Spellcasting within the cloud is impossible. Creatures in the insect plague, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage for each round they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. All creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice will automatically move at their fastest possible speed in a random direction until they are more than 240 yards away from the insects. Creatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must check morale; failure means they run as described above. Heavy smoke drives off insects within its bounds. Fire also drives insects away. For example, a wall of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently cast insect plague outside its confines, but a fireball spell simply clears insects from its blast area for one round. A single torch is ineffective against this vast horde of insects. Lightning, cold, or ice are likewise ineffective, while a strong wind that covers the entire plague area disperses the insects and ends the spell. The plague lasts two rounds for each level of the caster, and thereafter the insects disperse. The insects swarm in an area that centers around a summoning point determined by the spellcaster. The point can be up to 120 yards away from the priest. The insect plague does not move thereafter for as long as it lasts. Note that the spell can be countered by a dispel magic spell. The material components of this spell are a few granules of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat."

The spellcaster can easily make the moonbeam move to any area that he can see and point to. This makes the spell an effective way to spotlight something, an opponent, for example. While the moonbeam spell does not eliminate all shadows, a creature centered in a moonbeam is most certainly visible. The reflected light from this spell enables dim visual perception 10 yards beyond the area of effect, but it does not shed a telltale glow that would negate surprise. The light does not adversely affect infravision. The caster can dim the beam to near darkness if desired. The beam has, in addition, all the properties of true moonlight and can induce a lycanthropic change (of a creature in the beam), unless the DM rules otherwise. The material components are several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar (moonstone)."

Note that if the caster enters a tree, an ash, for example, and wishes to pass north as far as possible (540 yards), but the only appropriate ash in range is to the south, the caster will pass to the ash in the south. The pass plant spell functions so that the movement takes only one round. The caster can, at his option, remain within the receiving tree for a maximum of one round per level of experience. Otherwise, he can step forth immediately. Should no like tree be in range, the caster simply remains within the first tree, does not pass elsewhere, and must step forth in the appropriate number of rounds.

The quest can, for example, require that the creature locate and return some important or valuable object,rescue a notable person, release some creature, capture a stronghold, slay a person, deliver some item, and so forth. If the quest is not properly followed, due to disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature affected by the spell loses 1 from its saving throw rolls for each day of such action. This penalty is not removed until the quest is properly pursued or the priest cancels it. There are certain circumstances that will temporarily suspend a quest, and others that will discharge or cancel it. The DM will give you appropriate information as the need to know arises. If cast upon an unwilling subject, the victim is allowed a saving throw. However, if the person quested agrees to a task--even if the agreement is gained by force or trickery--no saving throw is allowed. If a quest is just and deserved, a creature of the priest's religion cannot avoid it, and any creature of the priest's alignment saves with a -4 penalty to the saving throw. A quest cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by a priest of the same religion or of higher level than the caster. Some artifacts and relics might negate the spell, as can direct intervention by a deity. Likewise, an unjust or undeserved quest grants bonuses to saving throws, or might even automatically fail.

These applications are as follows: Bow: The spell creates a shimmering, multi-layered short composite bow of rainbow hues. It is light and easy to pull, so that any character can use it without penalty for non- proficiency. It is magical: Each of its shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a +2 weapon, including attack and damage bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the effect of any missile fired from the bow. The bow fires seven missiles before disappearing. It can be fired up to four times per round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue leaves the bow, corresponding to the color of arrow that is released. Each color of arrow has the ability to cause double damage to certain creatures, as follows: Red --fire dwellers/users and fire elementals Orange --creatures or constructs of clay, sand, earth, stone or similar materials, and earth elementals Yellow --vegetable opponents (including fungus creatures, shambling mounds, treants, etc.) Green --aquatic creatures, electricity-using creatures, and air elementals Indigo --acid-using or poison-using creatures Violet --metallic or regenerating creaturesWhen the bow is drawn, an arrow of the appropriate color magically appears, nocked and ready. If no color is requested, or a color that has already been used is asked for, then the next arrow (in the order of the spectrum) appears. Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to form a seven-hued bridge up to 3 feet wide per level of the caster. It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 yards, according to the caster's desire. It lasts as long as the spell's duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster. The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the caster can substitute a diamond of not less than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with bless and prayer spells while in sight of a rainbow.

The length of time that the person has been dead is of importance, as the priest can raise persons dead only up to a limit of one day for each experience level of the priest (i.e., a 9th-level priest can raise a person who has been dead for up to nine days). Note that the body of the person must be whole, or otherwise missing parts are still missing when the person is brought back to life. Likewise, other ills, such as poison and disease, are not negated. The raised person must roll a successful resurrection survival check to survive the ordeal (see Table 3: Constitution) and loses 1 point of Constitution. Further, the raised person is weak and helpless, needing a minimum of one full day of rest in bed for each day or fraction he was dead. The person has 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic. A character's starting Constitution is an absolute limit to the number of times he can be revived by this means. The somatic component of the spell is a pointed finger.

Otherwise, those entering the spell's area of effect suffer 1d4 points of damage per round. The success of each attack is determined as if the caster of the spell were actually engaging in combat. Those entering the area are subject to attack immediately upon setting foot in the area and for each round spent in the area thereafter. The initial step enables the individual to become aware of some problem only if the initial attack succeeds; otherwise movement continues and the spike stones remain unnoticed until damage occurs. Charging or running victims suffer two attacks per round. Those falling into pits affected by spike stones suffer six such attacks for every 10 feet fallen, each attack having a +2 bonus to the attack roll. In addition, the damage inflicted by each attack increases by +2 for every 10 feet fallen. Finally, the creatures also suffer normal falling damage.

Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free themselves from the mud sink at the rate of 1/3 of their height per round and eventually suffocate, save for lightweight creatures that could normally pass across such ground. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it, with the amount required decided by the DM. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can move through the area at a rate of 10 feet per round. The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance--but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt at a rate of 1d6 days per 10 cubic feet. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage. The reverse, transmute mud to rock, hardens normal mud or quicksand into soft stone (sandstone or similar mineral) permanently unless magically changed. Creatures in the mud are allowed a saving throw to escape before the area is hardened to stone. Dry sand is unaffected.

One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of damage upon those within 20 feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 4d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, to any creature passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire maytake additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to directly catch moving creatures with a newly created wall of fire is difficult. A successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and direction of movement determine which side of the created wall it is on. The wall of fire lasts as long as the priest concentrates on maintaining it, or one round per level of experience of the priest in the event he does not wish to concentrate upon it. The material component of the spell is phosphorus."

    "Description": "While using this spell, the priest can command a flame to leave its source of fuel and move at his direction. The flame is magically preserved at the intensity it possessed when animated and does not weaken or fail even if it has nothing to burn. The priest can affect any natural fire within range, but magical fires (including breath weapons) can only be animated and controlled on a roll of 11 or higher on a d20, –1 per level or Hit Dice difference between the caster and the creature or spellcaster who created the flame in question. For example, a 9th-level priest can animate a flaming sphere cast by a 4th level wizard on a roll of 6 or better on 1d20. In order to animate instantaneous effects such as a red dragon’s breath or a fireball, the priest must beat his opponent’s initiative in the round he casts this spell and succeed in his attempt to take control of the flame. Under the priest’s direction, an animated flame can move at a rate of 12, although it cannot cross water or wet or muddy ground. If the priest directs the flame to leave the spell’s range, the spell ends and the flame stops and burns whatever it may be resting on. Animate flame can be a very effective weapon; the fire attacks with a THAC0 of 10 and may be able to strike several creatures in the same round, depending on its size. It inflicts damage as shown below: Number of Size Diameter Targets Damage Torch or lantern less than 1 ft. 1 1d3 Small campfire 1–2 ft. 1 1d4 Large campfire 3–5 ft. 2 1d6 Bonfire 6–10 ft. 4 2d6 Conflagration 11–20 ft. 8 3d6 Inferno 21 ft. or more 20 5d6 Creatures actually caught within the fire’s diameter are automatically hit (without an attack roll) for the listed damage. Very hot or unusually cold fires may inflict damage (at the DM’s discretion) as if they were one category larger or smaller. In addition to attacking the caster’s enemies, the fire will naturally cause any combustibles it comes into contact with to burn, as well; an animated fire can easily torch a small town, given a few rounds to move from building to building. The animated flame can be dispelled normally. It can also be defeated by contact with a significant volume of water, ice, cold, or earth or dirt, just as a normal fire can be drowned or smothered. The priest can affect a single fire of up to 1 foot in diameter per level of experience; if a natural fire is too large for him to animate, he can animate a smaller portion of it and command the portion he controls. Magical fires cannot be divided in this way, so it requires a very high-level priest to deflect the breath weapon of a red dragon!"

The affected creature can be forced entirely into its extraplanar dimension, which removes it from the physical world, or its extraplanar existence can be severed, forcing it entirely into the Prime Material Plane. If the priest’s level exceeds the subject’s level or Hit Dice, the subject is not allowed a saving throw, but creatures of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. Also note that magic resistance may apply, as well. If used to banish an extraplanar or multidimensional creature, dimensional translocation prevents the creature from returning to the Prime Material Plane for the duration of the spell. The creature may be able to take other actions, such as using magical items or spell-like abilities on itself while it waits to return. If the caster instead forces an extradimensional creature into the Prime Material Plane, one or more of the following effects may apply, at the DM’s option: The creature’s Armor Class may be reduced by 1d6 points for the duration of the spell. The quality of a magical weapon needed to strike the creature may be reduced by one “plus”; for example, a monster normally hit by +2 or better weapons may become vulnerable to +1 weapons for the spell’s duration. The creature may suffer permanent death upon the loss of all its hit points. Use of 1d6 spell-like powers (such as gating in allies) may be limited or negated. Undead creatures lose the ability to drain life energy levels. This spell does not prevent extradimensional travel on the Prime Material Plane (i.e., dimension door, blinking, teleport, or similar effects), but it does prevent the subject from plane shifting or becoming ethereal while in effect."

    "Description": "When a priest enters othertime, he steps into a different reality in which the world around him is frozen at a moment in the future. Until time catches up to him, he may move about unhindered and observe his surroundings; no force known can detect his presence or harm him in the alternate reality, although he in turn cannot affect any creature or object in the physical world. For instance, he could read a book at the page it was opened to, but he could not turn the page since that would require him to move an object that is temporarily immovable for him. To his companions or enemy in real time, the priest appears to simply vanish altogether, only to reappear at some later point. The duration of this spell is a little odd, to say the least. The priest may choose a duration of up to 1 round at 7th to 9th level, 2 rounds at 10th to 12th level, 3 rounds at 13th to 16th, 4 rounds at 17th to 19th, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level or higher. The duration chosen by the priest governs the length of the othertime; if the priest decides that the spell will last 2 rounds, then he is instantly transported to that point in time, surrounded by the frozen still-life of the world as it will appear 2 rounds after the priest cast othertime. The caster then has 2 rounds to himself to take any actions he cares to, although he cannot affect the real world by any physical, magical, or mental means. While the caster is in the othertime, he is completely unaware of the intervening events. In the example above, if the caster’s friends were teleported away 1 round after the caster left and replaced by an identical group of dopplegangers, the caster would have no chance to detect the switch; all he sees are the bodies of his “friends,” frozen in the positions they will occupy when he emerges from the othertime. This also means that nasty things like dragon breath, cloudkills, or mind blasts that pass through the spot where the caster happens to be have no effect on him—he simply does not exist in the real world while he waits for everyone else to catch up to him. As noted above, the caster gains an amount of subjective time equal to the duration of the spell. By leaping 3 rounds into the future, the caster gains 3 rounds of actions in the othertime. He could drink a potion, cast a spell, and then maneuver for an attack, for example, or he could gain a 3-round head start by running for his life while no one else can pursue him. If the priest uses this time to study a battle and position himself for an attack, he gains a –4 bonus to his initiative roll on the round he emerges from othertime, and a +4 attack bonus with his first strike. Leaping in and out of the time stream is a dangerous activity; every time the priest employs this spell, there is a 1% noncumulative chance that he becomes stuck in othertime, doomed to death by thirst or starvation when his own rations run out. Only the most extraordinary measures (a wish spell, divine intervention, etc.) can save a character in this predicament. Once a priest is in othertime, he cannot pray for further spells. After all, if the priest is going to attract his deity’s attention by praying for spells, the deity will most likely allow him out! The material component for this spell is an hourglass filled with rare salts, worth at least 100 gold pieces."

If there is no source of water or even enough humidity to support this spell, then the DM can rule that the spell has no effect. The caster affects a cubic area of 1 foot per level to a side, so a 12th-level caster affects a 12-foot by 12-foot by 12-foot cube (up to a maximum of 25 feet to a side). This can have several effects; first of all, any creature caught in the area of effect when the temperature is lowered suffers 2d4 damage plus 1 point per level of the caster (or 2d4+12, for the 12th-level caster described above), or half that damage with a successful saving throw vs. spell. Any fires in the area are suppressed and may (50% chance) be extinguished. Creatures entering the area of effect after the initial creation of ice suffer no additional damage, although the air will be noticeably dry and cold. However, the ice formed by the spell coats all surfaces and may cause creatures to slip and fall. Any creature moving into or out of the affected area must make a saving throw vs. spell or fall, losing their action for the round. The ice lasts at least 2 rounds per caster level, and then begins to melt at whatever rate nature decrees. If cast on a body of water, this spell creates an iceberg of the stated dimensions. A swimmer or aquatic creature could be caught in the ice and trapped until the ice melts; most air-breathers will suffocate from this treatment, but a few aquatic creatures (fish, amphibians, etc.) may survive being frozen, at the DM’s discretion.

Allies who share the same faith (not just alignment) of the caster are transported into the righteous wrath; they gain one additional melee attack each round and a +2 bonus to saving throws and attack and damage rolls. Creatures under the influence of the righteous wrath gain 1d8 additional hit points, which are the first points lost if the subject sustains any injury (see aid, on page 257 of the PHB). Characters in a state of divine frenzy are difficult to charm or hold. Against spells or effects that target the subject’s mind or emotions, the saving throw bonus increases to +3. When the spell ends, all remaining additional hit points are lost. Characters who fought under the righteous wrath find themselves extremely fatigued and must rest for one full turn before exerting themselves again; if forced to fight in this state, they are treated as if they were exhausted under the Combat & Tactics fatigue rules.

As a guideline, each additional 100 years of aging causes an increasingly severe reaction. Thus, after 200 years, parchment might become little more than powder, while iron might begin to flake away at a touch. Many items (especially gems) show little reaction to age. The DM must adjudicate all effects. The material components are a flask of seawater and a piece of coal. The reverse of this spell, youthful object, returns an object ravaged by the effects of time to its original condition; thus, rusty iron becomes strong and shiny, crumbled masonry becomes firm, and rotten wood becomes solid.

At the time of casting, the priest designates the recipient of the spell and the contributors. All characters who contribute to the spell must do so willingly. When the spell is completed, the designated character (the group's champion) gains any non-magical bonuses to THAC0 and damage possessed by the characters who contributed to the spell. Characters without bonuses or with combat penalties could conceivably be included in the spell; such characters count against the maximum number of creatures that can be affected. Penalties are likewise applied to the champion; contributors to this spell must be chosen carefully. The bonuses gained through this spell are added to the character's own bonuses (if any). The champion channels the energy of others through himself, improving his fighting ability. The champion must be in the line of sight and within 30 feet of the characters aiding him. Characters who contribute their bonuses must concentrate on the champion for the duration of the spell. If this concentration is broken (by moving more than 10 feet per round, fighting, being struck, or losing sight of the champion), that character's contribution is immediately lost. The spell expires when the last character contributing power to the champion ceases concentration. A champion may benefit from only one champion's strength spell at one time.

The spell affects jungles, forests, rocky ground, and snow. The result of the cleared path is that movement costs are reduced by half. This is reflected in a reduction of the penalty against movement in rough terrain. (See Table 74 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for terrain costs for movement.) For example, if clear path is used in heavy jungle, the movement cost is reduced from 8 to 4. In no case can clear path reduce movement cost below 1. Clear path has no effect on rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water, nor does it affect quicksand, lava, or similar natural obstacles. It also has no effect on magically-created terrain or manmade barricades. A priest using the clear path spell can be tracked easily. Tracking proficiency is not required.

The cloud of purification transmutes organic filth, garbage, and vermin (mice, rats, rot grubs, and so on) into an equal quantity of pure water. For example, a nest of rot grubs caught in the cloud would \"melt,\" becoming small puddles of clean water. If the spell is cast over a body of water, the cloud merges with a portion of the water equal to its own size, transmuting any filth, microbes, small fish, or other \"impurities\" into clean water. The cloud's vapors are heavier than air, so they sink to the lowest level of the land (even down holes in the ground). Thus, this spell is perfect for cleansing a sewer or well.

Using his knowledge of circumstances, the DM communicates these facts to the caster's player. This \"arcane message\" is normally straightforward and easy to understand, but in the case of highly complex circumstances, the message might be cryptic. In any case, the message will always be truthful. As an example, consider a priest and his party who are on a holy quest to retrieve an item of power. On the way to the location of this item, the party is ambushed by evil creatures from the Inner Planes but manages to defeat them. Concerned that these creatures might be outlying guards protecting the item of interest, the priest casts consequence, hoping for guidance. The DM knows that these creatures have nothing to do with the quest; the encounter was coincidental. However, the surviving monsters will soon be returning with reinforcements to avenge their dead. Therefore, the DM tells the priest's player, \"To your goals these have no place, but still they can cause more woe.\" Casting this spell \"taints\" subsequent castings of the same spell within a 24-hour span. A second attempt within this period always results in the same message as the first, regardless of the true situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 24 hours of another casting, he receives an accurate reading. The material component is three special coins or dice made of platinum (total value of at least 1,000 gp), which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell.

Disguise cannot change the size category of the unit's members. Thus, a unit of humans may appear to be a unit of elves, but may not appear as a unit of giants or halflings. The spell does not affect the size of the overall unit; a unit of 50 creatures will still appear to be a unit of 50 creatures. The disguised unit may appear to be carrying any melee or personal missile weapons (e.g., axes, long swords, crossbows, etc.), and may appear to be wearing any type of armor. In combat, however, the unit attacks and defends with its real weapons and armor regardless of the gear they may appear to be carrying. Disguise is most effective at long range.

The spell affects a cube whose sides equal the caster's level times 5 feet (a 12th-level priest could affect an area equal to a 60' x 60'x 60' cube). Elemental forbiddance has no effect on elementals that are within the area of effect when the spell is cast. If such elementals leave the area of effect, they cannot reenter. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and four glass beads, each of a different color (green, blue, red, and yellow). The priest must pace out the perimeter of the warded area at the time of casting."

    "Description": "This spell allows the priest to alter the characteristics of certain extradimensional spaces such as those created by rope trick and similar spells or those contained in items like bags of holding or portable holes. Extradimensional manipulation can increase or reduce the size of a single extradimensional space. The amount of increase or decrease depends on the level of the caster: Level Multiplier Up to 10 x2 11 to 16 x3 17 or above x4 This means that a 10th-level priest can double the capacity of a bag of holding or decrease it to half its normal size. A 15th-level priest can triple the capacity or reduce it to one-third capacity. If the size and capacity of an extradimensional space is decreased, any contents of the space that exceed the current capacity are expelled (determined randomly). These contents are expelled from the space in the same way they originally entered it, if that path is still open. If the path is closed, as it would be if a bag of holding were tied shut or a portable hole were folded up, the \"extra\" contents are expelled into the Astral plane. Any items in an enlarged space when the spell duration expires suffer the same fate. Placing an extradimensional space inside another such space, such as placing a bag of holding inside a portable hole (see the Dungeon Master's Guide), is a dangerous undertaking. Extradimensional manipulation may be cast for the purpose of removing this danger. When used in this manner, the size of the space cannot be affected. However, while this version is in effect, the affected extradimensional space can be placed within another such space (or another extradimensional space may be placed within the affected space) with no adverse consequences. If one space is within the other when the spell expires, the usual consequences ensue immediately. If the space to be affected is being maintained by a spellcaster, as in the case of a rope trick, that spellcaster receives a saving throw to resist the manipulation. If the space is created by a magical item, however, no saving throw is allowed. The material component is a strip of gold tissue worth at least 5 gp that is twisted into a Moebius strip. The strip is consumed in the casting."

    "Description": "Special Saving Throw: None This spell allows the priest to create a single extradimensional space or pocket like the one inside a bag of holding. The spell must be cast on a container such as a sack, bag, or backpack. Once under the influence of the spell, the container opens into a nondimensional space and is much larger inside than its outside dimensions. The container always weighs a fixed amount, regardless of what is put inside.

The platinum sheet must be inscribed with a drawing of a Klein bottle (a paradoxical figure with only one surface--the three dimensional analogue of the Moebius strip). The diamond dust is consumed during the casting--the platinum sheet is not."

It is impossible for victims to determine where the missiles were fired from; creatures under attack notice the missiles only when they are about to strike. The missiles never actually strike--they vanish inches above the victims' heads and do no damage. The illusion is so terrifying, however, that victims must immediately make a morale check. The first time a group or unit is the target of this spell, this morale check is made with no modifier. The second and subsequent times that the same unit is attacked with this spell, the unit receives a +1 bonus to its morale score (for checks against this effect only) unless the unit has been the target of real artillery fire in the interim.

The spell interferes with the victim's ability to make decisions. It prevents the victim from performing any action without first gaining the permission of the caster or a character designated by the caster. The victim will heed only the person designated by the caster. Before the victim undertakes any action, he must gain permission. He will not follow through with an action until he gains permission. If permission is denied, the victim cannot act until he thinks of an alternate action and gains permission for that action. Every round, the victim must decide his action for that round; at the victim's initiative, he must ask permission to perform his action. If permission is denied, the victim can take no other action that round. The only actions exempt from the need for permission are involuntary actions such as breathing. Asking and gaining permission takes only a short amount of time in most cases. A simple request, such as asking for permission to swing a sword in the middle of combat, can be accomplished quickly. Complicated requests, such as getting permission to act on a complicated plan, will naturally take more time. The DM may consider adding a modifier to the victim's initiative roll in such cases."

    "Description": "This cooperative spell requires only one priest to cast it, but can be cast only on another priest of the same faith. The recipient of the spell must voluntarily surrender himself to the spell. The recipient becomes a host for the caster. While the recipient does not lose his own persona or ability to act, the host can be dominated by the caster at any time. For the most part, this domination is complete. For the duration of the spell, the caster is essentially detached from his own body. He can neither move nor act on his own. His mind is connected to the host's. He sees, hears, smells, tastes, and otherwise senses everything the host does. He can telepathically communicate with the host. Once the spell is completed, there is no limit to the range over which it can function. However, both the caster and host must remain on the same plane. Since the spell relies on telepathic communication, thin lead sheeting will effectively block the connection. When desired, the caster can dominate the host. When this happens, the host's own mind is pushed to the background and the caster's personality dominates. The host's personality, memories, proficiencies, and spells are temporarily replaced by those of the caster. While occupying the host, the caster can cast any spell he himself has memorized, provided that the necessary components are on hand. These spells function exactly as if the priest had cast them from his own body. The caster can return control to the host at any time, restoring the character's abilities and personality without harm. The spell is not without limitations and risks. The domination must be voluntary. If the host resists the casting of the spell, it automatically fails. Once the spell is in effect, the host can attempt to resist the domination. He is then allowed a saving throw. If successful, the spell immediately ends. Whenever the host suffers damage, the caster must make a saving throw vs. death to maintain the spell. If the save is failed, a wave of pain is transmitted to the priest, causing 1d6 points of damage and canceling the spell. If the host should die, the caster must make a system shock roll with the risk of suffering instant death. The material component is a chalice worth no less than 1,000 gp. This chalice must be given as a gift to the host (who cannot return it to the donor for any reason)."

    "Description": "This nasty spell \"disconnects\" the subject's short-term and long-term memory. While the spell is in effect, the subject is incapable of storing information in long-term memory. Every moment is virtually an independent event for the subject; he or she can remember recent events, thoughts, and sensations for no more than a few seconds (the amount of time they remain in short-term memory). Memories of events that happened before the onset of the spell are not affected at all; these are safely stored in long-term memory. This means that the subject can cast any spells memorized before the memory wrack took effect, but he is likely to have difficulty casting the spell as described below. The subject of this spell has a limited ability to act. He is restricted to one action at a time and must concentrate mightily to keep the situation and any planned actions in short term memory. As long as the subject is able to maintain concentration, he may act normally within these limits. If the subject is distracted (he is struck in combat, affected by a spell, startled, surprised, or a similar event occurs), he forgets everything that occurred from the onset of the spell to the moment of distraction. The subject must re-evaluate the situation as if it had just come to pass. Consider the following example. The subject of the spell is a soldier assigned to guard the entrance to a building. The priest arrives and casts memory wrack on the guard. The guard has no problem remembering his orders, since he received them before the onset of the spell. He also remembers the arrival of the priest. The priest now tries to convince the guard that he is authorized to enter the building. The guard refuses him entry. The priest now picks up a rock and throws it at the guard, striking him and distracting him. The guard forgets everything that happened between the onset of the spell and the moment the rock struck. He forgets that the priest has already tried to con him and that he threw a rock at him. He must reevaluate the situation as though the priest had just arrived. The priest is free to make another attempt at entering the building. When the spell expires, the subject remembers nothing that happened while the spell was in effect, possibly leading to amusing consequences (\"By the gods, how did I get here?\"). The material component is a ruby of at least 200 gp value, which is crushed during the casting."

    "Description": "This spell allows the priest to create one specific form of insanity in the subject. Five forms of insanity are possible through this spell. Schizophrenia: This form of insanity is characterized by personality loss. The subject has no personality of his own, so he selects a role model and makes every possible attempt to behave like that character. The chosen role model will be as different from the subject as possible. (Thus, an insane wizard might begin to follow the habits of a warrior.) Obviously, a warrior who believes himself to be a wizard will be unable to cast spells (he might think that he's casting spells, or he might construct a sophisticated series of excuses explaining why he's \"not in the mood for magic\" at the moment). A character who emulates a member of another class does not gain any of the skills of that class and makes all attacks and saving throws as appropriate to his true class. Certain consequences might arise if the character's emulation causes him to break restrictions of his class. For example, a priest emulating a warrior might break his deity's prohibition against edged weapons, or a paladin might emulate a Neutral Evil thief. Both will suffer the appropriate consequences as if they had been compelled to violate their beliefs while charmed. Such characters will certainly have to atone for their actions once they return to normal. Dementia praecox: The subject is totally uninterested in any undertaking. Nothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is lethargic and filled with tremendous feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction. No matter how important the situation, it is 50% likely that the subject will ignore it as meaningless. Delusional insanity: The subject is convinced that he is a famous figure: a monarch, demi-god, or similar personage. Characters who fail to recognize the subject with the honor he deserves incur great hostility or disbelief. The subject acts appropriately to a station that he does not hold. He directs orders at real and imaginary creatures and draws upon resources that do not exist. Paranoia: The subject is convinced that \"they\" (whoever they are) are spying on him and plotting against him. Everyone around the subject, even friends and allies, is part of the plot. If any other character acts in a way that the subject can interpret as reinforcing this delusion, the subject has a 20% chance of reacting with violence. Hallucinatory insanity: The subject sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist. The more stressful the situation is to the subject, the more likely he will hallucinate. Although most hallucinations are external to the subject (that is, he perceives creatures, objects, and conditions that do not exist), there is a 10% chance that any hallucination will involve the subject's self-perception. For example, the subject might suddenly believe and act as if he had sprouted wings, grown to giant size, etc. When this spell is cast by a priest of 13th level or lower, the DM chooses or randomly selects one of these forms of insanity (and should feel free to invent other interesting symptoms). If the priest is 14th level or higher, he can personally select the form of insanity to afflict the subject. While under the effect of this spell, the subject can cast spells and use innate powers; the use of these abilities will be in accordance with the symptoms of the insanity, however. Player characters affected by this spell should be encouraged to role-play the appropriate effects to the limit. The duration of this spell depends on the sum of the subject's Intelligence and Wisdom scores. A saving throw is allowed on a periodic basis depending on this total. The spell is broken if a successful saving throw is rolled. Refer to the table that follows. Int+Wis Time Between Checks 8 or less 1 month 9 to 18 3 weeks 19 to 24 2 weeks 25 to 30 1 week 31 to 35 3 days 36 or more 1 day The effects of this spell can be removed by a limited wish, wish (or equally powerful magic), or by a heal spell cast for this specific purpose. The material component is a small bust of a human head, about 3\" in height, made from fine, delicate china. The priest shatters this bust during the casting."

For example, if a character fired an arrow and inflicted 4 points of damage, a repeat action spell will cause him to fire a second arrow that will also inflict 4 points of damage. As long as the victim of the first arrow is within range, the subject affected by repeat action will adjust his aim and fire the second arrow at him. If the victim of the arrow moves out of range, the subject will fire his second arrow in the direction of the recipient. If the recipient is out of sight, the subject will fire in the direction of the recipient's original location. The subject of a repeat action spell must be capable of performing the indicated action a second time. If a character has no arrows in his quiver, he cannot fire an arrow. If a wizard were ordered to repeat a spell, he would attempt the spell only if he had the spell memorized and had sufficient material components. If a subject discovered a gem during a given round, repeat action will only compel him to hunt again; he will not recover another gem unless a second gem is actually present. An unwilling subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to resist the effects of repeat action. The material components are two identical glass spheres, each an inch or less in diameter."

    "Description": "This cooperative spell can be cast by either a single priest or a group of priests. Thoughtwave allows the priest to send a short but powerful message to one or more specific individuals, informing them of his situation and general location. The spell instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster's general mental state--anger, fear, pain, despair, etc. The caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message, provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus, the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target \"fellow priests,\" \"superiors,\" \"adventuring companions,\" \"knights of Lord Harcourt,\" or \"villagers of Dopp.\" If more than ten individuals are in the group, those closest to the source will receive the impulse. There is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected outside the plane occupied by the caster. Creatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of Castle Varrack. The spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message. If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest involved in the casting. Increasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a suggestion. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target. Tripling the intensity (requiring at least five priests) gives the spell the force of a quest. This effect is also limited to a single target. In both cases, the target is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect of the suggestion or quest."

While within the area of effect of this spell, the priest (and only the priest) gains several special abilities: •His sense of sight is magically enhanced. He can see through normal darkness and can see invisible creatures and objects. He cannot see through solid objects, however, and the range of his magical sight is limited to 60 feet. •The priest has no need for food, water, or rest. He does not feel fatigue and regenerates 1 hit point per hour spent within the circle. However, he does not actually rest and therefore cannot regain spells until he sleeps. •He is totally immune to the effects of magical and natural fear, as well as sleep and charm spells. If the priest leaves the circle, the spell is broken. When the spell ends, the priest must rest for 1 turn per hour (or portion thereof) spent in the circle.

The casting priest need not have the ability to turn undead himself. Thus, an undead ward created by a 10th-level priest would turn creatures as if by an 8th-level priest. The results of the turning attempt are calculated normally. If a large number of undead assault the warded area, not all of them are turned by the spell, since the normal limitations apply. Undead who are unaffected by the turning attempt ignore the undead ward for its duration. Undead within the area of effect when the spell is cast are not affected.

    "Description": "This nasty spell causes a major disease and weakness in victims who fail a saving throw vs. spells at a -3 penalty. Afflicted individuals are immediately stricken with a sickening scourge that quickly spreads to cover their entire bodies. The blackened boils, magenta blotches, violet lesions, seeping abscesses, and malignant cysts are excruciatingly painful, and highly debilitating.In the short term, the Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma of each victim are reduced by 3. Attack rolls are similarly decreased by 3. The agonizing symptoms persist until a victim receives a cure disease, heal, or restoration spell bestowed by a more powerful priest than the original caster. Dispel magic and remove curse are powerless to mediate the symptoms of a scourge, but a wish will eradicate the infection immediately. A scourge may also lead to a long-term, debilitating illness. Those ignoring the malignant disease resulting from the spell's effects for more than a few days may be susceptible to much worse afflictions (such as gangrene, plague, or leprosy) that ultimately result in the victim's untimely death within 1-4 weeks. Furthermore, if a victim of the spell enters an area of dense population, there is always a chance that the disease may spread (1% per caster level) into an epidemic of massive proportions. These long-term effects of the scourge are left to the discretion of the DM. The material component is a specially prepared, black whip or riding crop, which is cracked in the direction of the intended victims during the casting of the spell. Because of its horrific affect, scourge is typically only granted to high priests of a malignant and evil god who is dedicated to spreading death and disease."

As with most spells that restore hit points, undead regeneration cannot raise a creature above its normal maximum. Noncorporeal undead can also be affected by reaching into the space they occupy. During the \"healing\" process, the spell temporarily shields the priest from dangerous contact with the undead, such as aging or paralysis. The reverse of this spell, drain undead, inflicts a like amount of damage. Note that the damage \"drained\" from the undead creature is lost. It is not gained as healing or extra hit points for the caster. The same protections against undead powers are conferred on the caster as with undead regeneration. Only one undead can be affected by either version of this spell."

    "Description": "This spell summons an invisible aerial servant to find and bring back an object or creature described to it by the priest. Unlike an elemental, an aerial servant cannot be commanded to fight for the caster. When it is summoned, the priest must have cast a protection from evil spell, be within a protective circle, or have a special item used to control the aerial servant. Otherwise, it attempts to slay its summoner and return from whence it came. The object or creature to be brought must be such as to allow the aerial servant to physically bring it to the priest (an aerial servant can carry at least 1,000 pounds). If prevented, for any reason, from completing the assigned duty, the aerial servant returns to its own plane whenever the spell lapses, its duty is fulfilled, it is dispelled, the priest releases it, or the priest is slain. The spell lasts for a maximum of one day for each level of experience of the priest who cast it. If the creature to be fetched cannot detect invisible objects, the aerial servant attacks, automatically gaining surprise. If the creature involved can detect invisible objects, it still suffers a -2 penalty to all surprise rolls caused by the aerial servant. Each round of combat, the aerial servant must roll to attack. When a hit is scored, the aerial servant has grabbed the item or creature it was sent for. A creature with a Strength rating is allowed an evasion roll, equal to twice its [pi]bend bars[xpi] chance, to escape the hold. If the creature in question does not have a Strength rating, roll 1d8 for each Hit Die the aerial servant and the creature grabbed have. The higher total is the stronger. Once seized, the creature cannot free itself by Strength or Dexterity and is flown to the priest forthwith."

    "Description": "This powerful spell enables the priest casting it to imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated object, or objects, then attacks whomever or whatever the priest first designates. The animated object can be of any nonmagical material whatsoever[md]wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. Attempting to animate an object in someone's possession grants that person a saving throw to prevent the spell's effect. The speed of movement of the object depends on its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a stone statue would move at 40 feet per round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object depends on its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage, while larger and heavier objects may inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of damage. The frequency of attack of animated objects depends on their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of the object per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movementability. Damage depends on the type of weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood, and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your DM will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic foot of material for each experience level he has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet[md]a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks."

The total Hit Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice his level, if the creature conjured is determined randomly. If a specific animal type is requested, the animal's Hit Dice cannot exceed his level. The DM selects the type of animal that appears if it is randomly called. Thus, a priest of 12th level could randomly conjure two mammals with 12 Hit Dice each, four with 6 Hit Dice each, six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight with 3 Hit Dice each, 12 with 2 Hit Dice each, or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every +1 hit point added to a creature's Hit Dice as _ of a Hit Die. Thus a creature with 4 + 3 Hit Dice equals a 4 _ Hit Dice creature. The conjured animals remain for two rounds for conjured animals remain for two rounds for each level of the conjuring priest, or until slain, and they follow the caster's verbal commands. Conjured animals unfailingly attack the priest's opponents, but resist being used for any other purpose--they do not like it, become noticeably more difficult to control, and may refuse any action, break free, or turn on the caster, depending on the nature of the creature and the details of the situation.

    "Description": "The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route that he is seeking, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors or under ground, a trap, or even a maze spell. Note that the spell works with respect to locales, not objects or creatures within a locale. Thus, the spell could not find the way to \"a forest where a green dragon lives\" or to the location of \"a hoard of platinum pieces.\" The location must be in the same plane as the caster. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead him to his destination, indicating at the appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, with concentration the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph. The spell ends when the destination is reached or when one turn for each caster level has elapsed. The spell frees the subject, and those with him, from a maze spell in a single round, and will continue to do so as long as the spell lasts. Note that this divination is keyed to the caster, not his companions, and that, like the find traps spell, it does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures. The spell requires a set of divination counters of the sort favored by the priest--bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved runes, or whatever. The reverse spell, lose the path, makes the creature touched totally lost and unable to find its way for the duration of the spell--although it can be led, of course."

The spell can be cast to create either fire seed missiles or fire seed incendiaries, as chosen when the spell is cast. Fire seed missiles: This casting turns up to four acorns into special grenadelike missiles that can be hurled up to 40 yards. An attack roll is required to strike the intended target, and proficiency penalties are considered. Each acorn bursts upon striking any hard surface, causing 2d8 points of damage and igniting any combustible materials within a 10-foot diameter of the point of impact. If a successful saving throw vs. spell is made, a creature within the burst area receives only one-half damage, but a creature struck directly suffers full damage (i.e., no saving throw). Fire seed incendiaries: This casting turns up to eight holly berries into specialincendiaries. The holly berries are most often placed, being too light to make effective missiles. They can be tossed only up to 6 feet away. They burst into flame if the caster is within 40 yards and speaks a word of command. The berries instantly ignite, causing 1d8 points of damage to any creature and igniting any combustible within a 5-foot-diameter burst area. Creatures within the area that successfully save vs. spell suffer half damage. All fire seeds lose their power after a duration equal to one turn per experience level of the caster--e.g., the seeds of a 13th-level caster remain potent for a maximum of 13 turns after their creation. No other material components beyond acorns or holly berries are needed for this spell."

At the option of the caster, the ward can be locked by a password, in which case it can be entered only by those speaking the proper words. Otherwise, the effect on those entering the enchanted area is based on their alignment, relative to the caster's. The most severe penalty is used. Alignment identical: No effect. If password locked, cannot enter area unless password is known (no saving throw). Alignment different with respect to law and chaos: Save vs. spell to enter the area; if failed, suffer 2d6 points of damage. If password locked, cannot enter unless password is known. Alignment different with respect to good and evil: Save vs. spell to enter this area; if failed, suffer 4d6 points of damage. If word locked, cannot enter unless password is known. The attempt does cause damage if the save is failed. Once a saving throw is failed, an intruder cannot enter the forbidden area until the spell ceases. The ward cannot be dispelled by a caster of lesser level than the one who established it. Intruders who enter by rolling successful saving throws feel uneasy and tense, despite their success. In addition to the priest's holy symbol, components include holy water and rare incenses worth at least 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

The tree upon which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of the caster's dwellingplace, within a place sacred to the caster, or within 100 yards of something that the caster wishes to guard or protect. The liveoak spell can be cast upon a healthy tree of small, medium, or large size, according to desire and availability. A triggering phrase of up to maximum of one word per level of the spellcaster is then placed upon the targeted oak. For instance, \"Attack any persons who come near without first saying sacred mistletoe\" is an 11-word trigger phrase that could be used by a caster of 11th level or higher casting the spell.

If dispelled, the tree takes root immediately. If released by the caster, it tries to return to its original location before taking root. Damage to the tree can be healed with a plant growth spell, which restores 3d4 points of damage. A plant growth spell used in this fashion does not increase the size or hit points of the liveoak beyond the original value. The caster needs his holy symbol to cast this spell."

There is a 20% chance, reduced by 1% per level of experience of the caster, that the transport delivers the caster to a similar species of plant from 1 to 100 miles away from the desired destination plant. If a particular destination plant is desired, but the plant is not living, the spell fails and the caster must come forth from the entrance plant within 24 hours. Note that this spell does not function with plantlike creatures such as shambling mounds, treants, etc. The destruction of an occupied plant slays the caster (see the plant door spell)."

    "Description": "When this spell is cast, waves of force roll forth from the caster, moving in the direction he faces and causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from the caster to the limit of the area of effect. Wooden objects above 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects (movable mantles, siege towers, etc.) move back. Objects less than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed splinter andbreak, and the pieces move with the wave of force. Thus, objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them with them. If a spear is planted to prevent this forced movement, it splinters. Even magical items with wooden sections are turned, although an anti-magic shell blocks the effects. A successful dispel magic spell ends the effect. Otherwise, the turn wood spell lasts for one round for each experience level of the caster. The waves of force continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration, pushing back wooden objects in the area of effect at a rate of 40 feet per melee round. The length of the path is 20 feet per level of the caster. Thus if a 14th-level priest casts a turn wood spell, the area of effect is 120 feet wide by 280 feet long, and the spell lasts 14 rounds. After casting the spell, the path is set and the caster can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power."

    "Description": "The wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a person's finger. Any creature breaking through (or crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers 8 points of damage, plus an additional amount of damage equal to the creature's AC. Negative ACs subtract from the base 8 points of damage, but no adjustment is made for Dexterity. Any creature within the area of effect of the spell when it is cast, crashes into the wall of thorns and must break through to move. The damage is based on each 10-foot thickness of the barrier. If the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes at least four turns to cut a path through a 10- foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fires burn away the barrier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect while doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this case, the cool side of the wall is that closest to the caster of the thorn wall. The nearest edge of the wall of thorns appears up to 80 yards distant from the caster, as he desires. The spell's duration is one turn for each level of experience of the caster, and it covers one 10-foot cube per level of the caster in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus a 14th-level caster could create a wall of thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall to block a dungeon passage, or any other sort of shape that suited his needs. The caster can also create a wall of 5-foot thickness, which inflicts half damage but can be doubled in one of the other dimensions. Note that those with the ability to pass through overgrown areas are not hindered by this barrier. The caster can dismiss the barrier on command."

Thus, in spring a tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather could be summoned. In summer a torrential rain, heat wave, hail storm, etc., can be called for. In autumn, hot or cold weather, fog, sleet, etc., could be summoned. Winter enables great cold, blizzard, or thaw conditions to be summoned. Hurricane-force winds can be summoned near coastal regions in the later winter or early spring. The summoned weather is not under the control of the caster. It might last but a single turn, in the case of a tornado, or for hours or even days in other cases. The area of effect likewise varies from about 1 square mile to 100 square miles. Note that several casters can act in concert to greatly affect weather, controlling winds, and working jointly to summon very extreme weather conditions. Within four turns after the spell is cast, the trend of the weather to come is apparent-- e.g., clearing skies, gusts of warm or hot air, a chill breeze, overcast skies, etc. Summoned weather arrives 1d12+5 turns after the spell is cast. Note that the new weather condition cannot be changed by the caster once it has been summoned. Once the weather is fully summoned, it cannot be dispelled. If the summoning is successfully dispelled before it has been completed, the weather slowly reverts to its original condition."

The priest can be transported any distance, from above or below ground. Transportation by the word of recall spell is safe within a plane, but for each plane the priest is removed, there is a 10% cumulative chance that the priest is irrevocably lost. The priest is able to transport, in addition to himself, 25 pounds of weight per experience level. Thus, a 15th-level priest could transport his person and an additional 375 pounds. This extra matter can be equipment, treasure, or even living material, such as another person. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. Note that unusually strong physical fields, such as magnetic or gravitational forces, or even magical applications can, at the DM's option, make the use of this spell hazardous or impossible."

    "Description": "This spell allows the priest to issue a command to any one creature within the spell’s range. The magic of the spell translates the priest’s order into a language or form the subject creature can understand. The creature must have an Intelligence of at least 1 in order to be affected by this spell; nonintelligent creatures (those with a score of 0) cannot comprehend any order, no matter how the priest phrases it. Other creatures gain a saving throw vs. spell to resist command monster, but only if they have an Intelligence of Exceptional (15) or better, or the creature’s levels or Hit Dice are equal to or greater than the caster’s. Just like the 1st-level spell command, this spell coerces the subject into obeying the priest’s one-word order to the best of its ability. The order must be absolutely clear and unequivocal; the subject will continue to obey for one round per two caster levels— six rounds at 12th level, seven at 14th, and so on. If this action places the subject in mortal peril, he may attempt a saving throw (whether he was originally entitled to one or not) in order to break free of the spell’s power. Therefore, ordering a character standing at the edge of a cliff to “jump” will create an opportunity for the subject to break free. A command to “die” or “sleep” renders the creature unconscious for the spell’s duration. Undead creatures are immune to this spell."

    "Description": "This potent defense surrounds the caster in a chaotic maelstrom of energy and demimatter that blocks or deflects many attacks. The entropy shield extends about two feet in all directions from the caster’s body. The warping effect of the field causes any melee or hand-to-hand attack to miss 50% of the time—even if the roll allows an attack to continue, the priest still gains a –2 bonus to his Armor Class. Normal missiles or hurled weapons miss automatically as the entropy shield deflects them from the caster. Even magical missile attacks (produce flame, magic missile, or Melf’s acid arrow, for example), siege engines, and giant-thrown boulders may be deflected as if they were hand-to-hand attacks. Against spells or effects that produce energy, gas, or other physical attack forms (fireball, lightning bolt, cloudkill, and other such spells) the entropy shield provides a 50% chance that the attack simply does not affect the protected priest. Even if the harmful energy or matter penetrates the shield, the caster gains a +2 bonus on his saving throw. This does not cause a spell to fizzle or fail; a priest standing in the middle of a fireball is simply not touched by the spell, which will inflict its normal damage on anyone else in the area of effect. Any spell or effect that does not create matter or energy to harm or hinder the victim can pass through the entropy shield normally, so mind-based attacks and magical effects such as petrification, paralyzation, enfeeblement, or polymorph (to name a few) can still affect the priest. In addition to its defensive benefits, the entropy shield has the ability to repel normal or giant-sized animals and creatures of lawful alignment, such as extraplanar monsters from the lawful planes. Any such creature attempting to attack the shielded priest in hand-to-hand combat must roll a saving throw vs. spell at the end of the round. If the creature fails, it recoils from the priest and cannot attack him physically for the remainder of the spell’s duration (although it could decide to turn on one of the priest’s companions). The material component for this spell is a gemstone worth at least 100 gold pieces that has been exposed to the chaotic energies of Limbo."

    "Description": "This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves as directed by the priest. The whirlwind can move by zigzagging along the ground or over water at a movement rate of 6. The whirlwind always moves after all other creatures have moved, and many creatures can avoid it simply by keeping their distance. If the cyclone exceeds the spell’s range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds—possibly endangering the caster or his allies—and then dissipates. Any creature of size L (large) or smaller that comes in contact with the whirlwind must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon or suffer 2d8 damage. Size M (man-sized) or smaller creatures who fail their first saving throw must attempt a second one, or be picked up bodily by the whirlwind and held suspended in its powerful winds, suffering 1d8 points of damage each round with no save allowed. The caster may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever he wishes, depositing the hapless souls wherever the whirlwind happens to be when they are released. Maintaining the whirlwind requires the caster’s full attention, and he cannot cast other spells or make any attacks while directing the spell’s course. If his concentration fails for some reason, he cannot simply cancel the spell. Instead, the spell becomes uncontrolled as described above and dissipates after 1d3 rounds. In truly desperate circumstances, priests of elemental air have been known to deliberately overrun their companions in order to carry them out of the path of some certain doom. Few care to repeat the experience. The material component for this spell is a handful of dust collected from a zephyr or snow from a williwaw."

Subjects affected by age creature must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change. Subjects cannot be aged beyond their natural life spans. If the priest's level indicates that a creature would be aged beyond this level, the creature is aged to one year short of his maximum age. The spell cannot cause a subject to die. Human and humanoid characters affected by the spell experience changes in appearance associated with increased age, such as gray hair and wrinkles. More significantly, they suffer losses in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when they reach certain age levels. These are summarized in Table 12: Aging Effects in the Player's Handbook. The Player's Handbook also provides rules for determining a character's base age. Nonmagical monsters can be affected by age creature. The DM determines a monster's current age and natural life span based on its description in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM or based on his own judgment. To determine the effects of aging on a monster, assume the following: a monster is middle-aged when it reaches half its natural life span; a monster reaches old age at two-thirds of its natural life span; a monster reaches venerable age in the last one-sixth of its years. A monster suffers the penalties which follow when it reaches these age levels. The penalties are cumulative and permanent (unless the affected monster becomes younger). Age Penalty Middle Age -1 to all saving throws Old Age -1 to all saving throws -1 to all attack rolls Venerable -1 to all saving throws -1 to all attack rolls The material component is a pinch of powdered emerald. The reverse of this spell, restore youth, permanently restores age that has been lost as a result of magic (such as an age creature spell). Restore youth reduces the age of the targeted creature by one year per level of the caster. The subject must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change. Subjects who become younger regain the lost ability scores described above. A subject cannot become younger than his actual age as a result of this spell.

    "Description": "This spell enables the caster to enchant a floor, ceiling, or single wall of a room to crush intruders. The enchanted surface can be no larger than a square whose sides equal the caster's level times 2 feet (a 13th-level priest could affect a 26' x 26' surface). The spell activates 1d4 rounds after any creature other than the caster enters the room. The intruder must be larger than a normal rat (larger than one-half cubic foot or weighing more than three pounds). When activated, the enchanted surface moves toward the opposite surface at a rate of 3 feet per round. Unless the spell is canceled by the caster, the enchanted surface continues to move until one of the following events occurs: •A creature with sufficient Strength (minimum score of 19) stops the enchanted surface from moving by succeeding a Strength check. Such a creature suffers no damage from the enchanted surface. If the creature prevents the enchanted surface from moving for three consecutive rounds, the wall returns to its original position and the spell is negated. If multiple creatures attempt to stop the wall, the highest strength score is used as a base score; one point is added to that score for every creature assisting. Thus, a creature with 16 Strength assisted by three creatures could attempt to stop the wall. •A strong or heavy object made of stone, wood, or metal is placed in the path of the wall. If the item survives a saving throw vs. crushing blow, the object successfully braces the wall. If the object holds for three consecutive rounds, the surface returns to its original position and the spell is negated. The DM must use discretion in determining the types of objects that will brace the wall. •Dispel magic or a similar spell or magical item is used to cancel the crushing wall. Creatures can avoid being crushed by using a potion of diminution, potion of gaseous form, or other devices or spells that reduce size. The crushing wall almost never touches the opposite wall, usually being stopped by debris. A gap of two inches or more usually remains between the walls. If the wall is not stopped, it causes crushing damage to everyone in the room. All creatures must make a saving throw vs. death. Those who fail are crushed to death. Those who save successfully suffer 5d10 points of damage. When the wall can move no farther, it returns to its original position and the spell is negated. The material components are a 1-inch iron cube and a walnut shell."

    "Description": "This spell allows the caster to temporarily convince himself that certain objects or as many as four creatures within the area of effect do not actually exist. While disbelief remains in effect, these objects or creatures cannot harm or hinder the caster. He can pass through them as if they did not exist and takes no damage from their attacks or actions. However, since these objects or creatures temporarily do not exist for the priest, he can take no action against them. If the creatures attack, the caster receives no Dexterity bonus to armor class (since this bonus represents dodging, and the priest is unable to dodge a creature that does not exist for him). The caster can attempt to disbelieve as many as four creatures within 60 feet of his position at the time of casting. He disbelieves the same four creatures for the duration of the spell. Alternatively, the priest can disbelieve any or all inanimate objects of up to 20 cubic-yard volume (thus, he may disbelieve a 12 foot by 15 foot area of 3-foot-thick wall). This volume must be centered on a point no more than 20 yards from the caster. These two options are mutually exclusive; the priest can disbelieve only creatures or objects, not a combination of both. Disbelieving a creature includes all gear, equipment, or treasure carried or worn by that creature; it does not include other objects that come into contact with that creature, such as walls, doors, chairs, etc. Disbelief is not automatic; it requires an extreme effort. To successfully disbelieve, the priest must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A successful save means the priest has disbelieved; an unsuccessful check means that the spell has failed and the priest has not convinced himself of the creatures' or objects' non-existence. While this spell is in effect, the DM must record any damage suffered by the priest from disbelieved creatures. When the spell ends, the caster makes a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest suffers only one-eighth of any damage inflicted by the creatures (round all fractions down); if the priest fails the saving throw, he suffers one-half of any damage inflicted (round fractions down)."

    "Description": "This spell changes the characteristics of a square region of terrain. The area can be no more than 120 yards on a side. The priest can effectively turn a flat plain into a slope of any direction, or may flatten an existing slope. The spell does not allow the priest to alter the pull of gravity, however. This spell lets the priest create or negate a height differential of as much as 20 feet (a 2\" slope in BATTLE SYSTEM™ rules measurements) within the area of effect. This can have various consequences; the best way to discuss the effects is by example. Example 1: Two units face each other on a flat plain. The priest can alter the slope of the terrain so that one unit is 2\" of elevation higher than the other. The unit that is upslope gains the combat benefits for higher ground, and the unit that is downslope must pay the movement cost for moving uphill if it wishes to approach the other unit. Example 2: One unit is on flat terrain; another unit, 6\" away, is on a hill of 2\" elevation. Using this spell, the priest can effectively eliminate this difference in elevation (raising the low ground or lowering the high ground). All combat and movement involving these two units is then conducted as if there were no elevation difference (i.e., no movement penalty, no combat benefit for higher ground, etc.). Alternatively, the priest could increase the height differential by 2\". Combat and movement would now be conducted as if the total difference in elevation were 4\". Example 3: A unit faces a hill of 3\" elevation. The priest casts gravity variation, decreasing the effective elevation of the hill to 1\". The unit pays a lower movement point cost to climb the hill. Alternatively, if the unit facing the hill were an enemy unit, the priest could increase the effective elevation to 5\". The priest must specify the degree and direction of change at the moment of casting. These parameters cannot be changed while the spell remains in effect. Gravity variation can have dramatic effects on siege engines and towers. Most siege engines can be moved only on the most gentle of slopes. By raising or lowering the effective elevation of siege engines by 2\", the priest can totally immobilize them by positioning them on a slope too steep to negotiate. In the case of siege towers, there is a 50% chance that the structures will topple over (totally destroying them). The material component is a tiny plumb bob; the plumb line must be made of platinum wire while the bob itself must be a gem of at least 1,000 gp value. The device is consumed in the casting."

    "Description": "The great circle is a powerful cooperative spell that can be used only by four or more priests, each casting the spell simultaneously. Because of the nature of this spell and its casting time, it is often used to cleanse grounds in preparation for the construction of a temple or sanctuary. When casting the great circle, the priests stand in a circle of no more than 20-foot diameter. Each faces inward; when the spell is completed, each priest faces outward, directing the energy of the spell. When the casting is complete, the spell takes the form of a radiant halo of golden light 20 feet above the ground. This halo quickly expands in a shimmering wave. It can pass through objects, with small arcs of the halo disappearing momentarily and reappearing on the far side. As the halo moves, it generates a high-pitched hum that varies in pitch, almost like a chorus. The halo moves slowly at first, but builds speed, reaching its maximum range at the end of one round. The radius of the golden halo is dependent on the number of priests casting the spell. Each priest adds 60 feet to the radius. Thus, four priests could generate a halo that extends 240 feet in all directions from the circle of priests. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of priests who may contribute to this spell, but the need for the priests to be within a 20-foot diameter circle sets a practical limit of 20 casters. The halo is pure energy tapped from the Positive Material plane. It causes harm to undead and evil beings within the area of effect. Undead creatures of 8 or fewer hit dice are instantly destroyed and are not allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect. More powerful undead suffer 1d8 points of damage per caster. A successful saving throw vs. death magic reduces this damage to half. Creatures of evil alignment suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster (a saving throw is allowed for half-damage). The reverse of this spell, the black circle, creates a ring of shimmering black energy. Paladins and priests of good alignment suffer 1d10 points of damage per priest in the circle. All other good creatures suffer 1d4 points of damage per caster. Affected creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. death magic to reduce the damage to one-half."

    "Description": "A priest casting this spell forces the victim of the spell to follow one specific law. The priest may choose any law prevalent in the area in which the priest and the victim currently reside. Thus, if a city has no laws about murder, the priest cannot command the person not to kill. The victim of the spell is forced to obey the letter of the law to the best of his ability. Thus, if a victim were commanded not to commit murder, he would go to any length to avoid murdering someone. Since the essence of this spell is tied to legal (and not moral) interpretation, characters may find loopholes that will allow them to work around the law in specific cases or to ignore the law in light of extenuating circumstances. When casting the spell, the priest must speak the law to the recipient in such a way that he can hear it. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the save is failed, the victim will never willingly violate the stated law as long as the spell is in effect. Legal thoughts can be negated by dispel magic. The victim of this spell never perceives anything wrong with adhering to the law, and therefore never seeks to have the spell removed."

The spell affects up to 10 Hit Dice or levels of creatures with Intelligence of 4 or lower. Creatures used as mounts must be of suitable size to carry at least one rider; smaller creatures can be used as pack animals. Each intended mount receives a saving throw vs. spell. Creatures failing their rolls become docile and obedient, allowing riders to mount them, and moving at the speed and direction indicated by the caster. To maintain the enchantment, the caster must remain within 10 yards of one of the affected creatures, and each affected creature must remain within 10 yards of another. The affected creatures will do nothing for the caster other than carrying riders and gear; they will not fight (although they will fight to defend themselves), nor will they intentionally endanger themselves. Any overtly hostile act by the caster or a rider against any mount breaks the enchantment for all the mounts. When the enchantment ends or is broken, the creatures take no action for one round, then behave as their natural instincts direct."

    "Description": "his spell causes a localized folding of space. The folded space takes the form of an invisible disk up to 20 feet in diameter. Any missile weapon or spell that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction. Melee factors such as speed, range, and damage are unaffected; the direction of the object or force is simply rotated through a 180 degree arc. The sender of the spell or missile finds himself the target of his own attack. The physical mirror operates from only one direction; that is, only one side of the mirror reflects attacks. The caster of the mirror may direct spells and missile attacks normally through the space occupied by the mirror. In the case of physical attacks, the attacker must roll to hit himself (without the armor class benefits of Dexterity or shield). Spells turned back may require the caster to make a saving throw vs. his own spell. In both of these cases, range is important. If the distance between the initiator of the attack and the physical mirror is more than twice the range of the attack, the attacker is safe; the attack has insufficient range to travel from the attacker to the mirror and back again. When the priest casts the spell, he must specify the location and orientation of the physical mirror disk. Once it is created, the disk cannot be moved. If two physical mirror disks touch or intersect, they destructively interact and both immediately vanish. The resulting \"ripples\" in the space-time continuum are exceedingly destructive and inflict 3d10 hit points of damage on any creature within 35 yards (a saving throw is allowed for half-damage). This always includes the casters of the physical mirror spells. The material component is a tiny mirror of polished platinum, worth at least 500 gp."

    "Description": "This spell is similar to the 9th-level wizard spell time stop. When reverse time is cast, time stops within a 30-foot diameter of the subject. All creatures and items in the area of effect stand motionless, rivers stop running, and arrows hang suspended in the air. Any creature, person, or object entering the area of effect is likewise frozen in time. The caster is affected if he is within the area of effect, unless he is the subject of the spell. An unwilling subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell; if successful, the spell is immediately negated. Otherwise, the victim is forced to relive all the actions taken in the previous 1-4 rounds in reverse. Beginning with the most recent round, the subject moves backward, arrows fired by the subject return to his bow, and so on. All effects of these actions are negated. At the end of the spell's duration, normal time resumes and all creatures immediately continue their activities, picking up right where they had stopped. Consider the following example. A party is battling a spellcasting red dragon. In the first round, the dragon breathes fire, roasting the party's wizard. The rest of the group attacks and injures the dragon. On the second round, the dragon bites and kills the group's thief. More damage is caused to the beast, but it is still alive in the third round, when it uses magic missile to kill the ranger. At this point, the priest casts reverse time on the beast. Fortunately, it fails its saving throw and is forced to reverse the last four rounds. While everyone else freezes, the dragon goes into reverse. The magic missiles zoom back to the dragon (and it regains the ability to cast that spell), it \"unbites\" the thief (removing that damage from the character), and then inhales its fiery breath (leaving the roasted wizard alive and uncooked). The dragon is then reversed through one more round--the round before it encounterd the party. The spell then ends and actions resume. The dragon must now roll for surprise since it is encountering the party for the first time. The party is immune to surprise, since it was fighting the beast previously. All damage suffered by the dragon remains, since these actions were caused by the group and not the beast. The material component is an etched silver arrow bent into a circle. The arrow must be no more than 3 inches long and worth no less than 500 gp. The arrow is destroyed in the casting."

    "Description": "This spell encloses one individual in an extradimensional space. Creatures to be affected must be of size M or smaller. The space can contain only one creature, regardless of size. The priest may use the spell on himself or any creature he touches. Unwilling targets are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the entrapment. While inside the space, the enclosed character is invisible and totally undetectable by any form of scrying. Powerful magic such as contact other plane will indicate that the character is \"elsewhere,\" but will give no more information. The creature within the extradimensional space can see and hear everything that occurs around him. However, he cannot cast spells, and no action of his can affect anyone or anything in the \"real world.\" While occupied, the extradimensional space is totally immobile. If the caster chooses to occupy the space, he can pass in and out of the space at will. Other creatures can leave or reenter the space only if the caster allows it. To an outside observer, an enclosed character who exits the space simply appears from nowhere. If the space is occupied when the spell terminates, the occupant is immediately ejected back into the real world and suffers 1d6 hit points of damage in the process. Any time the extradimensional space is empty, or when the occupant is someone other than the priest, the space follows the priest around. Thus, the priest may seclude a comrade in the extradimensional space, walk past some guards into a building, then release the comrade. If any other form of extradimensional space (such as a bag of holding ) is taken into the space created by seclusion, both spaces are ruptured and all contents are expelled onto the Astral plane. Extradimensional manipulation can temporarily prevent this. The material components are a tiny crystal box of the finest workmanship (worth at least 1,500 gp) and a gem of at least 250 gp value. The gem is consumed in the casting; the box is not."

No time passes for creatures affected by skip day; they are in the exact condition that they were in before the spell was cast. They are fatigued, have recovered no hit points, and carry the same spells. Wizards must wait for actual time to pass before they can memorize spells. The affected creatures remain in the same location as they were before skip day was cast. Their immediate environment is likely to have changed; for instance, fires have burned out, enemies who were attacking have departed, and weather has changed for better or worse. Although skip day is a possible substitute for teleporting out of a dangerous situation, it is not without risk; characters could reappear in a situation more threatening than the one they left behind (for instance, a forest fire may have started or a pack of hungry wolves may have arrived)."

The gem must be immediately thrown at an opponent, for it quickly becomes too hot to hold. (The acts of casting and throwing occur in the same round.) It is not possible for the priest to give the stone to another character to throw. The stone can be hurled up to 30 yards. The priest must roll normally to hit; he gains a +3 bonus to his attack roll and suffers no penalty for nonweapon proficiency. In addition, the glowing gem is considered a +3 weapon for determining whether a creature can be struck (creatures hit only by magical weapons, for example). There is no damage bonus, however. When it hits, the gem bursts with a brilliant, searing flash that causes 6d6 points of fire damage to the target and blinds him for 1d6 rounds. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. If successful, only half damage is sustained and the target is not blinded. Undead creatures suffer 12d6 points of damage and are blinded for 2d6 rounds (if applicable) if their save is failed. They receive 6d6 points of damage and are blinded for 1d6 rounds if the save is successful. If the gem misses its target, it explodes immediately, causing 3d6 points of damage (or 6d6 against undead) to all creatures within a 3' radius. It blinds them for 1d3 rounds (1d6 rounds vs. undead). All victims are allowed a saving throw vs. spell, with success indicating half damage and no blindness. The DM should use the rules for grenade-like missiles found in the Dungeon Master Guide for determining where the stone hits. The material component is a topaz gemstone worth at least 500 gp."

The casting effort severely weakens the priests, discouraging casual use of this spell. To cast the spell, six or more priests must be within a 15-foot radius. Each priest must cast spiritual wrath at the same time. Before beginning the spell, the priests must decide upon the area of effect. The spell causes 10d6+1d6 points of damage per priest casting the spell. (The minimum damage, therefore, is 16d6.) Creatures within the area of effect are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to reduce the damage to half. The spell strikes as a great wave of force that descends from the sky. Small objects must save vs. crushing blow. Structures suffer damage as if hit by a heavy catapult (2d12). The force of this spell often raises a great cloud of dirt and dust, obscuring the area for 1d4+1 rounds. The spell's area of effect is determined by the number of casters. Each priest contributes 10 feet to the radius of the spell. Six casters would create a spell with a radius of 60 feet. No more than twelve casters can cooperate to cast this spell (maximum of 22d6 damage and a 120-foot radius area of effect). This converts to an 8-inch circle in the BATTLESYSTEM™ rules ground scale. The spell is difficult to cast, physically taxing the spellcasters so much that each caster suffers 3d10 points of damage from the effort. There is no saving throw allowed to avoid this damage."

    "Description": "This spell asphyxiates individuals (chosen by the priest) who fail a saving throw vs. death magic. If fewer than six individuals are targeted with this spell, each receives a -1 penalty on their save (-2 for three creatures or less, -4 if the entire spell is focused on a single creature). This necromancy induces a victim's throat to constrict and his or her lungs to swell shut, similar to a severe allergic reaction, for so long as the subject remains within range of the spell. Each round, a victim must attempt a Constitution check. If failed, the victim suffers 1 - 6 points of damage. If successful, the subject manages to gasp in enough air to reduce the damage to 1-3 points. During its struggles against asphyxiation, the affected creature becomes effectively slowed (as per the 3rd- level wizard spell). A victim who fails three consecutive Constitution checks has been smothered and dies automatically on the following round. The effects of asphyxiate continue until either the spell expires, a victim withdraws beyond range of the spell, or a successful dispel magic is employed on a victim. Victims remain slowed for 1-3 rounds after the spell ends. This spell normally affects only humans or demihumans, though the DM may extend the dominion of the spell to include man-sized or smaller animals and monsters. Obviously, creatures (such as undead and plant creatures) that never breathe cannot be affected by this spell. The material component is an unholy symbol and a (symbolic) silken gag, which the priest loosely wraps around his or her own mouth after casting the spell. Because of its murderous effect, asphyxiate is typically granted only to priests serving evil deities."

Upon their arrival, lesser undead will usually seek to eliminate the priest at once unless he (or she) is suitably fortified behind protection from evil 10' radius. More powerful, intelligent undead may attempt to parley with the priest, but they will invariably end the conversation and attack once their initial curiosity has been satisfied. A priest must be prepared to command, cajole, entice, or destroy whatever creature has been called into his service. Whenever possible, the DM should choose what kind of undead answers the priest's summoning, based on the caster's current surroundings, level of ability, and alignment. Alternatively, the DM may roll a d20 and consult the following table: Roll Summoned Undead (Number Appearing) 1-8 Ghouls (4-16)9-12 Ghasts(2-8) 13-14 Shadows or Wights (2-5) 15 Wraiths or Mummy (1-3) 16 Spectre, Ghost, or Banshee (1) 17 Special (1) 18-20 No undead in range (0) Special undead might include sons of Kyuss, apparitions, crypt things, eyes of fear and flame, and any other unusual undead creature the DM may wish to introduce. In truly rare circumstances (for instance, if the spell is cast near a creature's lair), this spell might attract the attention of a more powerful undead, such as a death knight, vampire, or even a lich. These beings will seldom arrive in a predictable fashion and are the most likely to demand some form of nasty retribution or lavish sacrifice to appease. The summoned undead remain in the vicinity of the priest for at least one turn per level and may be commanded to assist the priest in his or her endeavors (including, possibly, attacking the caster's opponents). Unless fortified with resist turning, the undead summoned by this spell can be turned (or commanded) by priests other than the caster. Because it enlists the service of powerful and malicious undead, summon undead is granted only to priests serving evi deities."

The animated stone object must be separate (not a part of a huge boulder or the like). It follows the desire of the caster--attacking, breaking objects, blocking--while the magic lasts. It has no intelligence or volition of its own, but it follows instructions exactly as spoken. Only one set of instructions for one single action can be given to the animated rock, and the directions must be brief, about a dozen words or so. The rock remains animated for one round per experience level of the caster. The volume of rock that can be animated is also based on the experience level of the caster--2 cubic feet of stone per level, such as 24 cubic feet, a mass of about man-sized, at 12th level. While the exact details of the animated rock are decided by the DM, its Armor Class is no worse than 5, and it has 1d3 hit points per cubic foot of volume. It uses the attack roll of the caster. The maximum damage it can inflict is 1d2 points per caster level. Thus, a 12th-level caster's rock might inflict 12 to 24 points of damage. Movement for a man- sized rock is 60 feet per round. A rock generally weighs from 100 to 300 pounds per cubic foot. The material components for the spell are a stone and drop of the caster's blood."

As the Astral plane touches upon the first levels of all the outer planes, the priest can travel astrally to the first level of any of these outer planes as he wills. The priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane by means of the astral spell. However, a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral plane. The astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the caster's bodywhere the body rests on the Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic spell or destruction of the priest's body on the Prime Material plane--which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast, according to the priest's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the desire of the priest."

When the priest plants the end of the staff in the ground and speaks a special command and invocation, the staff turns into a treantlike creature with 12 Hit Dice, 40 hit points, and Armor Class 0. It attacks twice per round, inflicting 4d6 points of damage with every successful attack. The staff-treant defends the caster and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. The transformation lasts either for as many turns as the caster has experience levels, until the caster commands the staff to return to its true form, or until the staff is destroyed, whichever occurs first. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a sawdustlike powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff can be used again after 24 hours and the staff- treant is at full strength. To cast a changestaff spell, the caster must have either his holy symbol or leaves (ash, oak, or yew) of the same sort as the staff. The staff for the changestaff spell must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew tree struck by lightning no more than 24 hours before the limb is cut. The limb must then be cured by sun drying and special smoke for 28 days. Then it must be shaped, carved, and polished for another 28 days. The caster cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during either of these periods. The finished staff, engraved with woodland scenes, is then rubbed with the juice of holly berries, and the end of it is thrust into the earth of the caster's grove while he casts a speak with plant spell, calling upon the staff to assist in time of need. The item is then charged with a magic that will last for many changes from staff to treant and back again."

The passengers must be touched by the caster to protect them from the flames of the chariot. Creatures other than the caster and his designated passengers sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each round if they come within 5 feet of the horses or chariot. Such creatures suffer no damage if they evade the area by rolling successful saving throws vs. petrification, with Dexterity adjustments. The caster controls the chariot by verbal command, causing the flaming steeds to stop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, and turn left or right as he desires. Note that the chariot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation and can sustain damage. The vehicle and steeds are struck only by magical weapons or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1 point of damage). They are Armor Class 2, and each requires 30 points of damage to dispel. Naturally, fire has no effect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but magical fires other than those of the chariot can affect the riders. Other spells, such as a successful dispel magic or holy word, will force the chariot back to its home plane, without its passengers. The chariot can be summoned only once per week.

The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per two caster levels. Thus, seven to ten creatures can be affected by a 12th- or 13th-level caster, eight to 11 by a 14th- or 15th-level caster, etc. These creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10): d10 Reaction 1 Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell 2-6 Stand confused one round (then roll again)7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again) 10 Act normally for one round (then roll again) The spell lasts one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail their saving throws are checked by the DM for actions each round, for the duration of the spell, or until the \"wander away for the duration of the spell\" result occurs. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible in their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). This is not panicked flight. Wandering creatures also have a 50% chance of using any special innate movement abilities (plane shift, burrowing, flight, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. The material component of this spell is a set of three nut shells. Note: If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to successfully roll the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two who are supposed to attack the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stands confused, four attack, and one acts normally."

    "Description": "The control weather spell enables a priest to change the weather in the local area. The spell affects the weather for 4d12 hours in an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires one turn to cast the spell, and an additional 1d4 turns for the effects of the spell to be felt. The current weather conditions are decided by the DM, depending on the climate and season. Weather conditions have three components: precipitation, temperature, and wind. The spell can change these conditions according to the following chart: Precipitation Temperature Wind CLEAR HOT CALM very clear sweltering heat dead calm light clouds or hazy warm light wind PARTLY CLOUDY WARM moderate wind clear weather hot MODERATE WIND cloudy cool calm mist/light rain/hail COOL strong wind sleet/light snow warm STRONG WIND CLOUDY cold moderate wind partly cloudy COLD gale deep clouds cool GALE fog arctic cold strong wind heavy rain/large hail storm gale driving sleet/snow STORM hurricane The upper-case headings represent existing weather conditions. The lower-case headings below are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. In addition, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear, warm, and with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession. The material components for this spell are the priest's religious symbol, incense, and prayer beads or similar prayer object. Obviously, the spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions. If Weather is a major sphere for the priest (as it is for druids), duration and area are doubled, and the caster can change the prevailing weather by two places. For example, he can cause precipitation to go from partly cloudy to heavy sleet, temperature to go from cool to arctic, and wind to go from calm to strong."

The creeping doom slays any creature subject to normal attacks, as each of the small horrors inflicts 1 point of damage (each then dies after its attack), so that up to 1,000 points of damage can be inflicted on creatures within the path of the creeping doom. If the creeping doom travels more than 80 yards away from the summoner, it loses 50 of its number for each 10 yards beyond 80 yards. For example, at 100 yards, its number has shrunk by 100.

    "Description": "When this spell is employed, the priest confronts some powerful creature from another plane (including devas and other powerful minions, for instance, but not demigods or deities of any sort) and requires of it some duty or quest. A creature of an alignment opposed to the priest (e.g., evil if the priest is good, chaotic if the priest is lawful) cannot be ordered around unless it is willing. Note that an absolute (true) neutral creature is effectively opposed to both good and evil, and both law and chaos. The spellcaster must know something about the creature to exact service from it, or else he must offer some fair trade in return for the service. That is, if the priest is aware that the creature has received some favor from someone of the priest's alignment, then the exaction spell can name this as cause. If no balancing reason for service is known, then some valuable gift or service must be pledged in return for the exaction. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the past or promised favor or reward, and with the being's effort and risk. The spell then acts, subject to a magic resistance roll, as a quest upon the being that is to perform the required service. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to the vicinity of the priest, and the priest must then and there return the promised reward, whether it is irrevocable cancellation of a past debt or the giving of some service or other material reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. The DM adjudicates when an equitable arrangement has been reached. If the caster requests too much, the creature is free to depart or to attack the priest (as if the agreement were breached) according to its nature. If circumstances leave the situation unbalanced (for example, the creature dies while achieving a result that was not worth dying for), then this might create a debt owed by the caster to the creature's surviving kith and kin, making the caster vulnerable to a future exaction spell from that quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or release in the event of catastrophic failure or death are common casterpledges in securing an exaction. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in the priest being subject to exaction by the subject creature or by its master, liege, etc., at the very least. At worst, the creature can attack the reneging priest without fear of any of his spells affecting it, for the priest's failure to live up to the bargain gives the creature immunity from the priest's spell powers. The material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol, some matter or substance from the plane of the creature from whom an exaction is expected, and knowledge of the creature's nature or actions that is written out on a parchment that is burned to seal the pledge."

Creatures that roll successful saving throws vs. spell suffer only one-half damage. The damage is inflicted each round the creature stays in the area of effect. The area of effect is equal to two 10-foot x 10-foot cubes per level of the cater--e.g., a 13th-level caster can cast a fire storm measuring 130 feet x 20 feet x 10 feet. The height of the storm is 10 or 20 feet; the imbalance of its area must be in length and width. The reverse spell, fire quench, smothers twice the area of effect of a fire storm spell with respect to normal fires, and the normal area of effect with respect to magical fires. Fire-based creatures, such as elementals, salamanders, etc., of less than demigod status have a 5% chance per experience level of the caster of being extinguished. If cast only against a flametongue sword, the sword must roll a successful saving throw vs. crushing blow or be rendered nonmagical. Such a sword in the possession of a creature first receives the creature's saving throw, and if this is successful, the second saving throw is automatically successful."

Restoration is effective only if the spell is cast within one day of the recipient's loss of life energy, per experience level of the priest casting it. A restoration spell restores the intelligence of a creature affected by a feeblemind spell. It also negates all forms of insanity.

The creature, upon surviving a resurrection survival check, is immediately restored to full hit points and can perform strenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has reached its allotted life span (i.e., died of natural causes).

A wish spell or equivalent is required for recovery. Destruction requires a touch, either in combat or otherwise, and does not age the caster.

Once the item is enchanted, the priest must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the maximum encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly transported to the sanctuary of the priest, just as if the individual were capable of speaking a word of recall spell. No other creatures can be affected. The reversed application of the spell causes the priest to be transported to the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and situation of the item's possessor, and can choose not to be affected by this summons. This decision is made at the instant when the transportation is to take place. However, if he chooses not to go, the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is wasted. The cost of preparing the special item (for either version of the spell) varies from 2,000 to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can transport the subject from one plane of existence to another, if the DM allows. Note that the same factors that can prevent the operation of the plane shift and teleport spells can also prevent the use of this spell."

Unlike the wizard spell mind blank, the impervious sanctity of mind offers no protection against detection or scrying. However, it is effective against some attacks and powers that mind blank is powerless against. The spell requires a small ring of lead that was once breathed upon by a red dragon."

    "Description": "This mighty spell summons a tsunami, or gigantic wave, from any major body of water. The body of water must be at least 1 mile in width, so in most circumstances the tsunami can only be summoned from the sea, large lakes, or extremely big rivers. The wave is 2 feet high and 10 feet long for each level of experience of the caster, so a 15th-level priest would summon a tsunami 30 feet high and 150 feet wide. The wave can appear anywhere within the spell’s range and immediately sweeps forward in the direction specified by the caster. This may take it out of the allowed range or even back at the casting priest. The tsunami moves at a rate of 24 (240 yards per round) and lasts one round at 14th level, two rounds at 18th level, or three rounds at 22nd or higher level. Ships caught by the tsunami must make a seaworthiness check (see Table 77: Ship Types in the DMG) with a penalty equal to the wave’s height in feet. For example, a tsunami created by a 15th-level caster would inflict a –30% penalty to a vessel’s seaworthiness check. If the check is failed, the vessel capsizes and sinks in 1d10 rounds, with the possible loss of those aboard. Human or humanoid swimmers caught in the wave must make a saving throw vs. death magic or be drowned in the wave; any creature in the water in the wave’s path will be carried along as long as it lasts. If the priest sent the wave towards the shore, the tsunami loses 5 feet of height for every 20 yards it travels; a 30-foot wave could wash 120 yards inland before there was nothing left of it. Creatures caught in the area sustain 1d4 points of damage for every 5 feet of height the tsunami currently possesses and are carried along until it ends. Air-breathing creatures must make saving throws vs. death magic or be drowned outright by this treatment. Wooden buildings have a chance equal to three times the wave’s current height of being destroyed by the tsunami (90% for a 30-foot wave, for example) while stone buildings have a chance equal to the wave’s height (or 30% for a 30-foot wave). Topography may influence or channel the wave’s advance, so a good-sized hill could stop a tsunami cold, although its seaward face may be denuded of creatures and vegetation by the wave. Note that this spell in the hands of a high-level character can blanket an awesome amount of territory and literally destroy or drown anything in its path. The tsunami is so strenuous a spell that the priest is exhausted and helpless for 1d6 hours after summoning it."

For instance, a 14th-level caster could cause a dragon to gain or lose two age levels; a mature adult dragon could be temporarily transformed into a young adult dragon or into a very old dragon. A dragon's age cannot be reduced below hatchling or increased beyond great wyrm. Unwilling dragons are allowed a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty to avoid the effect. A dragon affected by age dragon temporarily acquires the armor class, hit points, spell abilities, combat modifiers, size, and other attributes of his new age level. The dragon retains his memories and personality. At the end of the spell's duration, the dragon returns to his normal age level. If the dragon suffered damage while experiencing his modified age, these hit points remain lost when he resumes his normal age. If the dragon loses more hit points at his modified age than he has at his actual age, he dies when the spell expires. For example, a young adult bronze dragon with 110 hit points is aged to a mature adult with 120 hit points. The dragon suffers 115 hit points in combat. Unless the dragon is healed of 6 points of damage before the spell expires, the dragon dies at the end of the spell since his damage is greater than his actual hit points. If a dragon is killed while under the effect of age dragon, he is dead at the end of the spell's duration. The material component is a handful of dirt taken from a dragon's footprint."

The priest need not touch or even see the diseased people for the spell to be effective, although recipients must be within the area of effect. This spell does not cure all diseases in the community at one time; the caster must specifically state which disease is to be eliminated (black plague or yellow fever, for example) with each casting of the spell. When the spell is cast, the priest exhales a sweet-smelling breath. This forms into a breeze that radiates outward, forming a circle that expands in a 50-yard radius per hour. During this time, the caster must remain at the center of the area of effect. For example, after 12 hours, the breath of life would cover a circle 1200 yards in diameter (600-yard radius). The breath is of a magical nature rather than a physical nature; therefore, it is unaffected by prevailing winds. The breeze blows through the community, instantly eliminating the specified disease from all afflicted citizens. The breath of life spell does not destroy parasitic monsters (such as green slime, rot grubs, and others), nor does it cure lycanthropy or other magical afflictions. The spell does not prevent recurrence of a disease if the recipients are again exposed. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a cone of incense that has been blessed by the highest priest of the character's religion. The breath of death, which produces a foul-smelling wind, is the reverse of this spell. Victims who fail a saving throw vs. death magic are afflicted with a nonmagical, fatal disease. To determine the results of this spell, the DM should roll saving throws for major NPCs in the area of effect. The effect on the rest of the community can be calculated as a percentage, based on the saving throw. Infected creatures do not heal hit points until the disease is cured. The disease is fatal within 1d6 weeks (the duration varies from person to person). The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dust taken from a mummy's corpse."

The road is approximately one foot thick and hovers in the air. It has the texture and color of black granite. Characters and creatures can move on the hovering road at their normal movement rate, ignoring the effects of surrounding terrain. The hovering road must originate from a solid surface. Once anchored, the caster controls the contour of the road, causing it to rise and fall as he wishes. The road can thus be used to traverse rivers (if the road is anchored on the shore), swamps, and similarly hostile terrain. The caster can cause the hovering road to rise over a jungle or cross a chasm. The road has AC 0. It is impervious to non-magical weapons. If the road suffers 100 points of damage (from magical weapons or other magical forces), it dissipates in a black mist; all those on the road fall to the ground below.

    "Description": "he ritual required to cast this spell is time-consuming and extremely complex. As its name implies, illusory fortification creates an illusion of a wall of heavy stonework up to 30 feet tall and 160 yards long, topped with crenellations. The illusory wall can be of any color and apparent age, potentially allowing the caster to match the false wall with the real walls of an existing castle. The illusory wall must be continuous (it cannot form two or more shorter walls), but it can follow any corners or bends that the caster desires. In addition to the wall, the spell creates the illusion of constant movement among the crenellations, as if defending troops were moving atop the wall. The formation of the crenellations makes it impossible for a distant observer to determine exactly how many and what types of defenders are present on the illusory fortification. The illusory wall remains in existence for 2d12 hours unless the spell is terminated earlier. The spell has one very significant limitation: it is strictly two-dimensional and is visible from only one side (the side that the caster deems to be the \"outside\"). When viewed from the outside, the wall appears real; when viewed from the end, from above, or from the \"inside,\" the wall is totally invisible except for a faint outline of the shape of the wall. This means that friendly troops, concealed from enemy view by the illusory wall, can see their opponents clearly. The wall is most effective if friendly troops are informed of the wall's presence and are careful not to walk through the illusion. Such an occurrence does not end the spell, but it will probably advise the enemy of the nature of the wall. Spells cast at the wall and shots fired at the illusory fortification by siege engines appear to strike the wall and inflict normal damage. In reality, the missiles or spells pass through the illusion, possibly striking troops or real fortifications beyond. Such \"hits\" do not disturb the illusion. As soon as an enemy unit moves within 10 yards of the illusory fortification, the spell terminates and the wall vanishes. There are two ways in which the spell can be terminated before it expires. First, the priest can terminate the spell at any time. Second, if a friendly unit makes an attack, whether melee or missile combat, through the illusory wall from the \"inside\" to the \"outside,\" the spell terminates instantly. Once the illusory fortification has been created, the priest does not need to concentrate on the wall. The spell remains in effect even if the casting priest is killed in the interim. The material components are the priest's holy symbol, a handful of stones, powdered mortar, and a gem worth at least 3,000 gp. All components except the holy symbol are consumed in the casting."

    "CastingTime": "1 turn",
    "Duration": "Special",
    "Description": "The mind tracker is a magically-created creature which exists only on the Ethereal plane. It is called into existence when the first portion of this spell is cast. When seen (which is seldom), the mind tracker has an indistinct body. It seems to be a near-solid coalescence of the vaporous atmosphere of the Ethereal plane itself. It is a roughly elliptical body with three or more limbs protruding at seemingly random locations. The number and size of these appendages shifts slowly, however, as new ones appear from the mist and old ones disappear. The body of the creature averages 2 feet across and 3 feet long, though this, too, tends to vary from minute to minute. The mind tracker has no discernible eyes, ears, nose, or other organs. It cannot be engaged in combat; if attacked, it simply disappears, to reappear after the danger has passed, or somewhere else entirely if its quarry has moved on. The ceremony which creates the mind tracker takes one turn to perform. Its material components are a whiff of the Ethereal plane's atmosphere and the brain of a lizard. Once the tracker is manifested, it must be assigned a quarry within one hour. If no quarry is designated, the tracker dissipates and the spell is wasted. To assign a quarry to the tracker, the priest must have the quarry within his sight. This includes magical sight such as true seeing, but not remote sighting devices such as crystal balls. With the quarry in sight, the priest mouths the final phrases of the spell. From that point on, the mind tracker is mentally tethered to the victim. It follows its quarry (staying always in the Ethereal plane) wherever it goes. It constantly relays information about the subject to the priest: what it is doing, where it is. The priest does not actually see an image of the quarry, he receives `reports' from the mind tracker. These reports contain only such information as the tracker can gather by looking. It cannot identify people the quarry is talking to, but can describe them in great detail. Nor can it hear anything the quarry or anyone else says, or read writing, but it recognizes and can report the fact that speaking or reading is happening. While the tracker is dogging its quarry, its presence can be felt as an eery, creepy sensation of being watched. If the victim makes an initial save vs. paralyzation, each of the following stages lasts three hours instead of two. For the first two hours, the quarry has a general feeling of ill ease. In the third and fourth hours, the victim is distracted and nervous, and suffers a -1 penalty on all saving throws. In the fifth and sixth hours, the victim is convinced someone or something is following him and suffers a -3 penalty on saving throws and a -2 (or -10%) penalty on all other dice rolls. After six hours the victim is near his breaking point. He is unable to concentrate to cast spells or use any of his class's special abilities. All die rolls have a -5 (or -25%) penalty. After eight hours, he must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. If he fails, he collapses, fevered and delirious. This state persists until the tracker ceases to exist. The mind tracker continues to exist for as long as the priest remains conscious of its input. If the priest is knocked out or falls asleep, or simply dismisses his creation, the tracker dissipates."

Like the creatures created by the spell shadow monsters, these illusory engines have at least a tenuous reality and can inflict damage on enemies. Shadow engines are accompanied by illusory crews of the appropriate number and race. The engines can move at a rate of 20 yards per turn and are unaffected by terrain considerations. (The caster can choose to slow them when passing through rough terrain to aid the illusion of reality.) Shadow engines cannot carry real troops. They can be fired at the same rate as real engines of the appropriate type, but a hit causes only one-half the damage normal for that type of engine (round fractions down). A shadow engine remains in existence until the spell duration expires, until an enemy unit approaches within 10 yards, or until it suffers damage from an enemy missile attack. When any of these conditions occur, the engine vanishes. If a single spell has created multiple engines, only the engine struck vanishes; the others remain. The crew associated with a shadow engine must remain with that engine; it cannot move more than 5 yards away from the engine itself. Shadow engines can move independently of other engines created by the spell as long as they remain within the area of effect and remain within 240 yards of the caster. The caster must maintain concentration to control the shadow engines. He cannot cast any other spells, and he is limited to a movement rate of 6. If the caster is struck for damage, the shadow engines vanish. The material component is a finely detailed miniature model of a siege engine (of any type), which is consumed during the casting."

    "Description": "50-foot-diameter sphere Saving Throw: None According to one view of the universe, what we perceive as gravity is actually a localized warping of the fabric of space-time. The spacewarp spell creates a temporary but very intense warping in a limited area. When the priest casts this spell, he selects a specific point to be the center of effect. This point may be anywhere within 50 yards of the caster, including in midair. When the spell is completed, this center of effect gains a gravity field equal to the force felt at the surface of the earth. In other words, gravity is centered at this point; everything within 50 feet of this center that is not attached to something immovable will fall toward the selected point. This localized gravity affects only loose objects and creatures capable of movement (i.e., not trees, whose roots are buried in the ground). It does not affect the ground itself- soil, plants, desert sand, lake water, etc. are immune to the effect. An object falling toward the center of gravity gains speed exactly as it would if it were falling toward the ground. When the object reaches the center, it instantly ceases its movement. If objects are already at the center, newly arriving objects will slam into them, causing normal falling damage (1d6 per 10 feet) to the newly arriving objects. Objects previously at the center must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount of damage. Consider the following example. An orc is 10 feet away from the center of effect when the spell is cast. He falls 10 feet to the center and stops. His companion, a bandit, is 30 feet from the center. It takes him longer to fall to the center, so the orc is already there when he arrives, and the two characters collide forcefully. The bandit suffers 3d6 hit points of damage--the falling damage associated with a 30-foot fall. The orc must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount. Other things are caught in the effect as well. The bandit's horse was 50 feet away from the center of effect, so it arrives at the center after the orc and the bandit. It falls 50 feet, suffering 5d6 points of damage, and potentially inflicting half that amount on both the orc and the bandit. The center of effect can be anywhere within 50 yards of the priest. Possibly one of the most destructive uses of this spell is to cast it directly on an enemy creature. Everyone and everything within 50 feet of that creature falls toward him and strikes him, inflicting damage. When the spell terminates, gravity returns to normal. If the spell has lifted any characters or objects off the ground, they immediately fall back to the ground, suffering the appropriate amount of falling damage. The material components are a lodestone and a sphere of obsidian, both of which are consumed in the casting."

The spell must be cast by six priests of the same faith. All six must touch hands at the time of casting. At the completion of the spell, the priests fall into a trance. The life essences of the priests leave their bodies and merge at a point within 10 feet of the casters. The spirits of the priests meld together to form the avatar of the priests' deity. In this manner, the six characters become a single being with all the powers and abilities allowed to that avatar. The only stipulation is that the priests' deity cannot have created all avatars allowed to it at that moment. If this has happened, the spell fails and the priests are drained as described below. If the spell succeeds, the priests have completely given their wills over to their deity, essentially forming the vessel into which it funnels power. In becoming the avatar, the priests retain the ability to make most of their own decisions. (The six must work in harmony or allow one of their number to decide all actions.) However, the deity can assume direct control of the avatar at any time it desires--the avatar is, after all, an earthly manifestation of the deity. Although the spell has a duration of one hour, the deity is not obliged to release the priests at that time. If the priests are not released at the end of the spell's duration, they instantly die. A deity can choose to sacrifice its priests in order to maintain its avatar on the Prime Material plane. Such a cruel and unjust action is almost never undertaken by good deities or those that have any respect for life, free will, or mercy. For dark and sinister gods, the question is much more uncertain. If a deity chooses to maintain the avatar longer than one hour, control of the avatar instantly and permanently passes to the DM. (Clearly, a DM should seldom if ever exercise this power.) While the priests are formed into the avatar, their bodies remain in a death like trance. The priests have no idea what might be happening to their real bodies (unless the avatar can observe them). Any damage to a priest's body requires an instant system shock roll. If successful, the damage is recorded normally, but the damage does not take effect until the spell ends (at which point the priest will almost certainly die). If the system shock roll is failed, the character instantly dies and the spell ends. Characters who die in this manner cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated. They have been taken to the ultimate reward (or punishment) for the service they have rendered. If the bodies are moved from their positions, the spell ends. Even if the deity releases the priests, they are left severely drained. All spells memorized are lost until the priest can rest and perform his prayers once again. The physical drain leaves each priest with only 1 hit point upon awakening, regardless of the number of hit points the character had when the spell was cast. Since damage suffered during the spell takes effect instantly, any priest who is hurt dies immediately (although quick action by others might save him). Each priest who survives the spell will be bound by a quest (a duty that must be completed in exchange for calling upon their god). The material component is an offering appropriate to the deity. The DM determines the exact nature of this offering."

The whip-like tentacles grow to the length of the room and swing wildly. Each round, a tentacle has a 30% chance of striking a random creature in the room, inflicting 1d6 points of damage (save vs. spell for half damage). Each tentacle has AC 0 and 25 hit points. When a tentacle is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears in a puff of black smoke.

Weapons simply bounce off the subject as they would bounce off the hardest stone. Spells, including dispel magic, are totally incapable of affecting the subject in any way. The subject does not age. Aside from the fact that the subject remains visible, frozen in place like a statue, he is effectively no longer part of the universe. (DMs may rule that the most powerful of magics, such as wishes, and creatures of demigod or higher status can affect the subject.) When the priest casts the spell, he or she states the duration for which the spell will remain in effect (the maximum is one full day per level of the caster). Once the spell is cast, this duration cannot be changed; the priest cannot terminate the spell before the stated time has elapsed. If the subject is unwilling to be affected by the spell, the priest must touch the victim for the spell to take effect; the subject receives a normal saving throw to resist the effects. A willing subject need not make a saving throw. The priest may cast this spell on himself if desired. This spell can provide a powerful defensive maneuver; while the spell is in effect, the subject is totally invulnerable. Timelessness is also an effective form of long-term imprisonment, as long as the priest is around to cast the spell again at the appropriate time. This is an exceptionally powerful spell. Casting it puts a significant strain on the priest. Each time he casts timelessness, the priest must make a system shock roll. If the priest fails this throw, he or she permanently loses 1 point of Constitution. The material components are a gem worth at least 1,000 gp and a small cylinder of obsidian.

Instead, torrential floods will assault a desert, a heat wave will rage in polar wastelands, and tornadoes and hurricanes will rip across gentle landscapes. A blizzard might spring up in summer or a tornado might materialize in the winter. The spellcaster has no influence over the weather pattern that emerges. He cannot control the area of effect or the duration of the weather.

Torrential Rain/Blizzard: Visibility is reduced to 100 yards or less; travel is nearly impossible due to water or heavy snow on the ground. Storm/Hurricanes: All flying creatures are driven from the skies; trees are uprooted; roofs are torn off; ships are endangered. Heat Wave: Intense heat immediately causes ice bridges to melt; avalanches of snow and ice roll down mountains. The DM determines the area of effect randomly. The maximum duration of the spell is one turn per level of the caster; however, the DM may cancel the effect after a shorter time."

    "Description": "By completing this ritual, a high priest forges a powerful pact with his or her deity. The covenant ensures that a chosen individual will survive an untimely death. A death pact is triggered whenever the protected individual is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points (mortally wounded) due to combat, spell, or accident. In the same round, the subject receives the following benefits: l The individual (or his or her remains) and all possessions are transported immediately back to a religious sanctuary as if by a word of recall (the location of the sanctuary must be specified at the time of forging the death pact). l Upon arrival, the individual receives a raise dead spell (if necessary) and automatically makes any required system shock roll. l Any physical damage sustained by the individual is completely healed except for 2-5 (ld4+l) points of damage.l Any severed or amputated limbs are instantaneously regenerated. l The body is cleared of lingering enchantments with a dispel magic (bestowed at caster's level), whether beneficial or baneful, and cleansed of all poisons, diseases, blindness, curses, and insanity. A death pact will remain in effect indefinitely until the conditions established at the time of its forging have been fulfilled. The pact may be established to benefit an individual other than the caster. However, in almost all cases, the chosen one must be in good standing with the caster's religion and agree to undertake a mission that will directly benefit the deity or dark power responsible for granting the spell. A dispel magic cannot end a death pact prematurely. This powerful spell is not without its costs, however. Forging a death pact is an exhaustively stressful process, drawing the priest into draining audiences with extraplanar powers. As a result, establishing a death pact ages the caster five years and requires at least one week for complete recuperation, during which time the priest cannot cast any spells or engage in any physically demanding activity. Furthermore, when the pact is invoked, the mystical transport and instantaneous healing exacts another toll, this time aging the recipient for five years (if the individual was raised, he or she also loses one point of Constitution permanently). Thus, if the priest casts the spell on him- or herself, he or she must be prepared to sacrifice at least ten years of life! The spell's material components are an (un)holy sanctuary consecrated to the caster's deity and seven drops each of the caster's blood, the recipient's blood, (un)holy water, and dew. This powerful pact has enabled many \"slain\" priests to return from the dead and eliminate their enemies. Wicked necromancers in the service of evil deities are rumored to have significantly reduced the terrible personal toll on the caster by some unspeakably foul sacrifice. Note that powerful wizard necromancers might achieve a similar effect with wish-fortified contingency spells."

The spell has no effect on a person already armored or a creature with Armor Class 6 or better. It is not cumulative with the shield spell, but it is cumulative with Dexterity and, in case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement or prevent spellcasting, and adds no weight or encumbrance. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster. (It is important to note that the armor does not absorb this damage. The armor merely grants an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the armor spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class gained.

    "Description": "When the audible glamer spell is cast, the wizard causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or remain at a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created, however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster. The volume is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster's direction. Note that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the phantasmal force spell. The material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax."

    "Description": "Cantrips are minor spells studied by wizards during their apprenticeship, regardless of school. The cantrip spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the cantrip spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of the spell. However, these effects are so minor that they have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the unseen servant spell, it's a tool to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard."

The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with any adjustment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the person receives damage from the caster's group in the same round the charm is cast, an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received is added to the victim's saving throw. If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but he might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the person to hold back an onrushing red dragon for \"just a minute or two.\" Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim's language to communicate his commands). The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person's Intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, andthis saving throw is checked on a periodic basis, according to the creature's Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.

    "Description": "This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth. Magical properties are not increased by this spell--a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size. For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered. The reverse spell, reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch--the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness. For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron."

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened senses of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls. Normal familiars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.). The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to 1 mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic--while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus, a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communications to its master would be tinged with fear of the \"big ones\" it was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar's eyes. If separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizard's saving throws against special attacks. If a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed. If the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies. The power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1,000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a dispel magic spell send them away. Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiar's relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one's own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.

Those who successfully save can reach the nearest nongreased surface by the end of the round. Those who remain in the area are allowed a saving throw each round until they escape the area. The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance; for example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured! Thespell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item--a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while creatures wielding or employing items receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw is failed, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to use the greased item. The caster can end the effect with a single utterance; otherwise, it lasts for three rounds plus one round per level. The material component of the spell is a bit of pork rind or butter."

Note that the subsequent suggestion is not a spell, but simply a vocalized urging (the caster must speak a language the creature understands for this spell to work). Creatures that successfully roll their saving throws are not under hypnotic influence. Those who are exceptionally wary or hostile save with +1 to +3 bonuses.

    "Description": "When an identify spell is cast, magical items subsequently touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately preceding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw. The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveals nothing). Only one function of a multifunction item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell. The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charged ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged. After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character). The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100 gp value) and an owl feather steeped in wine; the infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: Exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multifunctional item can be learned from a single reading. At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned."

The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must have a line of sight and unobstructed path for the spell when it is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a moveable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, the applicable magic resistance and saving throw rolls must be made. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function, but if cast directly against magical darkness negates it (but only for the duration of the light spell, if the darkness effect is continual). Light centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack rolls and saving throws by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4.

Likewise, the caster must be able to identify the target. He cannot direct a magic missile to \"Strike the commander of the legion,\" unless he can single out the commander from the rest of the soldiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) cannot be damaged by the spell, and any attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no effect. Against creatures, each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile--he hastwo at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles at 9th level.

If the object bearing Nystul's magical aura has an identify spell cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner has a 50% chance of recognizing that the aura has been placed to mislead the unwary.

The illusion lasts until struck by an opponent--unless the spellcaster causes the illusion to react appropriately--or until the wizard ceases concentration upon the spell (due to desire, moving, or a successful attack that causes damage). Saving throws for illusions are explained under \"Illusions\" in Chapter 7: Magic and under \"Adjudicating Illusions\" at the beginning of Appendix 2. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion see it for what it is and add +4 to associates' saving throws if this knowledge can be communicated effectively. Creatures believing the illusion are subject to its effects (again, as explained in Chapter 7). The illusionary effect can be moved by the caster within the limits of the area of effect.

Second, any attempt to possess (as by a magic jar attack) or to exercise mental control over (as by a vampire's charm ability) the protected creature is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, but it does prevent the exercise of mental control through the barrier. Likewise, a possessing life force is merely kept out. It would not be expelled if in place before the protection is cast. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil, if such attacks require touching the protected being. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character. This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. To complete this spell, the wizard must trace a 3-foot-diameter circle on the floor (orground) with powdered silver. This spell can be reversed to become protection from good; the second and third benefits remain unchanged. The material component for the reverse is a circle of powdered iron."

The spell affects 2d4 Hit Dice of monsters. Monsters with 4+3 Hit Dice (4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more are unaffected. The center of the area of effect is determined by the spellcaster. The creatures with the least Hit Dice are affected first, and partial effects are ignored. For example, a wizard casts sleep at three kobolds, two gnolls, and an ogre. The roll (2d4) result is 4. All the kobolds and one gnoll are affected (_ + _ + _ + 2 = 3 _ Hit Dice). Note that the remainder is not enough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre. Slapping or wounding awakens affected creatures but normal noise does not. Awakening requires one entire round.

    "Description": "A spider climb spell enables the recipient to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as well as a giant spider, or even hang upside down from ceilings. Unwilling victims must be touched and are then allowed a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. The affected creature must have bare hands and feet in order to climb in this manner, at a movement rate of 6 (3 if at all encumbered). During the course of the spell, the recipient cannothandle objects that weigh less than a dagger (one pound), for such objects stick to his hands and feet. Thus, a wizard will find it virtually impossible to cast spells if under a spider climb spell. Sufficient force can pull the recipient free; the DM can assign a saving throw based on circumstances, the strength of the force, and so on. For example, a creature with a Strength of 12 might pull the subject free if the subject fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately difficult saving throw). The caster can end the spell effect with a word. The material components of this spell are a drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of which must be eaten by the spell recipient."

    "Description": "When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to inscribe, visibly or invisibly, his personal rune or mark, as well as up to six additional characters of smaller size. A wizard mark spell enables the caster to etch the rune upon stone, metal, or any softer substance without harm to the material upon which the mark is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell will cause it to glow and be visible (though not necessarily understandable). Detect invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes will likewise expose an invisible wizard mark. A read magic spell will reveal the maker's words, if any. Themark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell. If cast on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the mark to fade. The material components for this spell are a pinch of diamond dust (about 100 gp worth) and a pigment or pigments for the coloration of the mark. If the mark is to be invisible, the pigments are still used, but the caster uses a stylus of some sort rather than his finger."

    "Description": "A spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something inimical. Without actually knowing what this is, the wizard merely advances threateningly upon the creature. If the creature does not make a successful saving throw vs. spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible, though items carried are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty, until it successfully saves and the spell is broken. In any event, the spell functions only against creatures with Intelligences of 2 or more, and undead are not affected at all."

    "Description": "A taunt spell enables the caster to jape and jeer effectively at a single type of creature with an Intelligence of 2 or greater. The caster need not speak the language of the creatures. His words and sounds have real meaning for the subject creature or creatures, challenging, insulting, and generally irritating and angering the listeners. Those failing to save vs. spell rush forth in fury to do battle with the spellcaster. All affected creatures attack the spellcaster in melee if physically capable of doing so, seeking to use body or hand-held weapons rather than missile weapons or spells. Separation of the caster from the victim by an impenetrable or uncrossable boundary (a wall of fire, a deep chasm, a formation of set pikemen) causes the spell to break. If thecaster taunts a mixed group, he must choose the type of creature to be affected. Creatures commanded by a strong leader (i.e., with a Charisma bonus, with higher Hit Dice, etc.) might gain a saving throw bonus of +1 to +4, at the DM's discretion. If used in conjunction with a ventriloquism spell, the creatures may attack the apparent source, depending upon their Intelligence, a leader's presence, and so on. The material component is a slug, which is hurled at the creatures to be taunted."

It floats along horizontally within its range of 20 yards at the command of the caster, and will accompany him at a movement rate of no more than 6. If unguided, it maintains a constant interval of 6 feet between itself and the wizard. If the spellcaster moves beyond range (by moving faster, by such means as a teleport spell, or by trying to take the disc more than 3 feet from the surface beneath it), or if the spell duration expires, the floating disc winks out of existence, and whatever it was supporting crashes to the surface beneath it.

With respect to such voices and sounds, anyone rolling a successful saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty detects the ruse.

If the components lie underground or underwater at a depth greater than 10 feet, they cannot be conjured, even if the caster is at a similar depth (such as in a cavern or at the bottom of a lake). The spell will not cause the appearance of components whose value exceeds 1 gp. Thus, it is impossible to summon gemstones, crystals, metals, pearls, etc. Additionally, components cannot be manmade or altered from their natural state (coins, jewelry, cut or crushed gems, mirrors, etc.), nor can they be taken from someone else's possession. A single conjure spell component spell will summon three components per level of the caster. They may be three different components or multiples of a single component.

D4 Roll Result 1 Desired component appears. 2 Component does not appear. 3 Creature is teleported to the caster. 4 Caster is teleported to the creature. Only animals with Intelligence scores of 1-4 can be affected by this spell. Humanoids and fantastic animals (dragons, bugbears, unicorns, etc.) cannot be affected.

    "Description": "Hornung, one of the leading wizards in the field of wild magic (before his untimely disappearance while experimenting with wildwind ), developed this spell to improve the accuracy of his estimates. The spell provides a wizard with an instant and highly accurate estimate of the number of persons or objects in a group. The spell's area of effect is one group of a general class of objects. All objects of the group must be within spell range and the group as a whole must be visible to the caster. The wizard need not see every individual in the group, merely the general limits of the group's size and area. For example, a wizard on a hill could look down on a forest and estimate the number of trees in all or part of it. He could not get an estimate of the number of goblins within the forest, however, since the group as a whole (the goblins) is concealed from sight. The estimate generated is accurate to the largest factor of ten (rounded up). For example, if Hornung's guess were cast on a group of 431 horsemen, the estimate would be 400. If there were 2,670 horsemen, the spell would estimate 3,000. If there were 37 horsemen, the answer would be 40. Clearly, using the spell on small groups (especially those with fewer than 10 members) is pointless. Hornung's guess can be used to quickly estimate the size of treasure hoards and army units. It is particularly popular with moneylenders and generals."

When cast, the mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process. Before casting the spell, the mage announces the spell effect he is trying to create. The mage must be able to cast the spell (i.e., have it in his spell books), but need not have it memorized. After announcing the spell (along with the target and any other conditions required by the spell), the wild mage casts Nahal's reckless dweomer. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is rolled randomly on Table 2: Wild Surge Results. Because the release of energy is planned by the mage, his level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result may be beneficial to the mage or it may be completely disastrous; this is the risk the mage takes in casting Nahal's reckless dweomer."

The caster can see such things as pottery shards reformed into a whole pot, shreds of paper formed into a page, scattered parts as a working machine, or specific trails appearing out of overlapping footprints. After casting the spell, the mage studies seemingly random elements--broken bits of glass, shreds of paper, intermingled trails, etc. The items to be studied must be tangible-- coded flashing lights, garbled speech, or thoughts of any kind cannot be studied. The wizard must study the random elements for one round, after which the DM secretly makes a saving throw vs. spell for the wizard. If the saving throw is failed, the spell fails. However, if the saving throw is successful, the caster sees in his mind the pattern these objects form. If the items studied are truly random, no information is gained. After the caster has visualized the pattern, he can attempt to reassemble the parts into their original form. This requires another saving throw vs. spell to determine whether the mage remembers sufficient details to accomplish the task. The amount of time required and the quality of restoration vary according to the complexity of the pattern. Reassembling a shredded map may be easy; reassembling a broken clock is significantly more difficult; rebuilding a shattered mosaic is extremely difficult. In any case, the wizard can make only a reasonable copy of the item. He can use this spell to restore works of art, but they will be worth only a small percentage of their original value. The material component is a small hand lens through which the caster studies the objects. The lens is not consumed in the casting."

Within the limits described below, the sphere can appear in a variety of colors; each color indicates a different special power. The caster can hurl the sphere at an opponent up to 30 yards away, providing there are no barriers between the caster and the target. If the target is no more than 10 yards away, the caster's to hit roll is made with a +3 bonus. If the target is 10-20 yards away, the caster's roll is made with a +2 bonus. If the target is 20-30 yards away, the caster's roll is made with a +1 bonus. If the chromatic orb misses its target, it dissipates without effect. If the target creature makes a successful saving throw, the chromatic orb is also ineffective. Otherwise, the color of the orb determines the amount of damage inflicted and its special power, as summarized on Table 16; details about the special powers are listed below. The caster can create a single orb of any color listed for his level or lower; for instance, a 3rd-level wizard can create an orange, red, or white orb. The material component for this spell is a gem of the appropriate hue or any diamond. The gem must have a value of at least 50 gp. Light from the orb causes the victim to become surrounded by light to a radius of 20 feet, as if affected by a light spell. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time the victim makes his attack rolls and saving throws at a -4 penalty, and his AC is penalized by 4. Heat from the orb is intense enough to melt 1 cubic yard of ice. The victim suffers a loss of 1 point of Strength and 1 point of Dexterity (or for victims without these attributes, -1 to hit and a penalty of 1 to AC) for 1 round. Fire from the orb ignites all combustible materials within 3 feet of the victim. Blindness from the orb causes the victim to become blind as per the spell. The effect lasts for 1 round/level of the caster. Stinking cloud from the orb surrounds the victim in a 5-foot-radius noxious cloud. The victim must save vs. poison or will be reeling and unable to attack until he leaves the area of the vapors. Magnetism from the orb has an effect only if the victim is wearing armor made from iron. The iron armor becomes magically magnetized for 3-12 (3d4) rounds. Other iron objects within 3 feet of the caster will stick tight to the magnetized armor; only dispel magic or a similar spell can release the stuck items. At the end of the spell's duration, the stuck items are released. Paralysis from the orb causes the victim to become paralyzed for 6-20 (2d8 + 4) rounds; a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation halves the number of rounds. Petrification from the orb turns the victim to stone. If the victim successfully saves vs. petrification, he avoids turning to stone and instead is slowed (as per the spell) for 2-8 (2d4) rounds. Death from the orb causes the victim to die. If the victim successfully saves. vs death magic, he avoids death and instead is paralyzed for 2-5 (1d4 +1) rounds.

However, divining rod will not locate invisible or magical items, nor will it locate items protected by obscure item or a similar spell. Once the branch is enchanted, the caster holds the branch with both hands. If the desired item is within the range of the spell, the enchanted branch points in the direction of the item and gently pulls the caster along. The spell is not blocked by lead or any other substance. However, if an impenetrable obstacle is reached, such as the ground or a wall, the branch presses against it and stops. If there is no item matching the description within the spell range, the branch does not react, although the caster can move about and continue to search. The material component for this spell is the branch from a ginkgo tree or a fruit tree, such as peach, apple, or lemon. The branch must be shaped like the letter Y, so that the caster can grasp a fork of the branch in each hand."

    "Description": "This spell creates undead skeletons and zombies from the bones and bodies of dead animals, specifically vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals). The animated remains obey simple verbal commands given by the caster, regardless of the language employed. Only naturally occurring animals of no higher than semi-intelligence can be animated with this particular spell (lizards, cats, frogs, weasels, tigers, and so on), including minimals and non-magical, giant-sized animals. These undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or turned; the animating magic cannot be dispelled. The number of undead that a wizard can animate depends on the animal's original hit dice, the caster's level, and the type of undead being created. The caster can create the following number of animal skeletons: l 1/4 HD animal or less: 4/caster level l 1/2 to 1 HD animal: 2/caster level l 1+ to 3 HD animal: 1/caster level l 3+ to 6 HD animal: 1/2 caster levels l Animal of over 6 HD: 1/4 caster levels The caster can create the following number of animal zombies: l 1/4 HD animal or less: 2/caster level l 1/2 to 1-1 HD animal: 1/caster level l 1 to 3 HD animal: 1/2 caster levels l Animal of over 3 HD: 1 /4 caster levelsAnimated skeletons of animals that had 1/4 to 1 HI) conform to the statistics of animal skeletons (see Skeleton in the MC). Skeletons of animals that had less than 1/4 HD when living conform to those same statistics/ with the following changes: AC 9, HD 1/4; hp 1, #AT 1, Dmg 1. Skeletons of those animals of over 1 HD conform to the regular animal statistics in the MM, with the following changes: armor class is worsened by two (AC 10 maximum), damage per attack is reduced by two (1 hp minimum), and movement is reduced by half. Animal zombies conform to the statistics for the particular animal that has been animated, with the following changes: the animal's number of hit dice is increased by one, AC is worsened by three (AC 8 maximum), and movement is reduced by half. Skeletal and zombie animals gain the standard undead immunities (resistance to cold-based, sleep, charm, and hold spells), but lose any normal defenses that the living animal might have had. They also lose any special attacks (raking of rear claws, swallowing whole, and so on) and cannot inject poison or emit fluids, such as musk or saliva. Swallowing does no further damage to the creature swallowed, except to trap it within the swallower's rib cage. Priests gain a +1 bonus when turning these undead. This spell is often a necromancer's first experience animating corpses. For this to work, the animal bodies or skeletons must be intact. The material components are a blood drop and bone chip from the same species as the target remains (only animals belonging to the same species may be animated per spell)."

    "Description": "With this versatile spell, a wizard establishes a sensory link between him- or herself and a corpse or freshly animated zombie of a human, demihuman, or humanoid within the spells range. This link allows the caster to gather sensory information from the vicinity of the cadaver or undead being. For every three levels of experience past the 1st, the wizard gains the ability to collect information from an additional sense via the corpse link. At 4th level, for instance, the wizard may choose up to two senses (up to three at 7th level, four, at 10th level, and all five at 13th level). Sight: The caster can see what the corpse or undead creature sees as if looking through one of the creature's eyes. Sound: The wizard can now hear through one ear, exactly as if standing at the corpse's current location (if a wizard/thief, the caster can use his or her hear noise ability too). Smell: With one nostril, the wizard can now smell things exactly as if standing at the corpse's current location. The spell conveniently masks the putrefying stench of the cadaver (if any) so that subtle variations of aroma (like the scent of a rose) can easily be detected. Taste: The caster can taste any substance which is introduced into the corpse's mouth. The substance (which may be solid or liquid) tastes exactly as if the wizard had placed it on one side of his or her own tongue. This can be especially useful when checking for poison in food or identifying unknown potions. Thankfully, the taste of the corpse's own rotting flesh can be masked out by the spell. Touch: The caster gains the ability to sense the textural and environmental conditions, with a single hand, as if standing at the corpse's location. The wizard can gauge the surface texture and temperature of anyobject or substance which is placed in contact with the corresponding hand of the corpse. The type and number of sensory signals is chosen by the wizard at the time of casting, and cannot be changed for the duration of the spell. The caster collects all the sensory information through a single organ (eye, ear, nostril, half of the tongue, or hand) belonging to the corpse or undead recipient. This organ need not be attached to the rest of the cadaver for the spell to function properly. While the spell is in effect, the wizard can still see/hear/smell/taste/touch normally through other (unlinked) organs. For example, a necromancer harvests the left eye from a fresh cadaver (with a successful Anatomy ability check) and places it on a high ledge, with a strategic view of a front door. If the spell is now cast, the wizard's left eye would be able to see through the left eye of the corpse and spy on any visitors, while his or her right eye remains normal. Furthermore, if the target of the spell is a zombie, the magic enables the caster to issue simple commands to the undead creature via this link. The commands can be no longer than four words and can deal only with the creature's movement (turn left, walk forward two steps, and so on) If either the caster or the undead creature moves beyond the range of the spell, the effects arc negated. Corpse link does not impart any animation to dead tissue; if cast on a regular cadaver, it remains stationary for the duration of the spell. The material component is a fresh corpse or a newly-animated zombie. Unless some form of preservative magic has been employed to protect the corpse's decaying sensory organs (such as embalm or spirit bind), this spell cannot be employed on the remains of one who has been dead for longer than 1 day per level of the caster. This spell also requires the appropriate sensory organ of an animal or monster noted for its keen senses (such as the eyes of a hawk, ear of a rabbit, snout of a pig, and so on)."

More powerful wizards can thus affect bigger pests, including large spiders, stirges, poisonous snakes, and giant or huge centipedes. If the targeted creatures are extremely small (1 hp or less), then an area up to 1 cubic foot per level (10 cubic feet maximum) can be cleansed of pests. This spell is well-suited to indoor or outdoor applications and is a favorite among necromancers who live among pestilence.

Scanning in a direction requires one round, during which time the caster remains motionless in concentration. Locate remains is mostly unaffected by walls or obstacles, though the area of effect is decreased (to 10' + IV level) by more than three feet of solid stone, ten feet of wood or packed earth, or one inch of metal. In the most general application, the spell precisely locates any and all physical remains of individuals in the area of effect, regardless of sex, species, and undead status. This spell does not impart any knowledge regarding the identity (or undead nature) of the remains; only the current locations of corpses within the area of effect are learned. If a personal item or a small fragment of the deceased individual is available at the time of casting, the spell can be used to locate the remains of that specific individual. In that case, the spell docs not register the presence of any remains except those of the desired individual. Both the general and specific versions of the spell have no effect if cast on a living creature of any kind. The material component for this spell is either a small piece of bone from a human cadaver (for the general version) or else an article of clothing, personal possession, or strand of hair (for the specific version). This spell is popular in regions with strict burial customs."

In the case of a cadaver or zombie, it will sound similar to the hoarse, scratchy voice of the deceased individual. In the case of a skeleton, the voice will sound like a soft, raspy whisper. For the duration of the spell (which cannot be ended prematurely), the caster's voice emanates from the corpse or undead creature. As a result, the wizard is unable to cast any additional spells requiring verbal components until after the spectral voice has expired. The material component is a preserved tongue."

It is useful for recording conversations, verbal agreements, interrogations, or even notes or observations if the wizard doesn’t want to take the time to write them down himself. Generally, a person reading aloud takes about one to five minutes to read a page, depending on how many words are on a page. Foreign languages are not translated, although foreign words are given the correct alphabetic spelling in the wizard’s native tongue; for example, the phrase c’est la vie would appear as it does here, with no English translation, but a phrase or name in Arabic or Chinese would not be transcribed in those alphabets. Magical spells and invocations are not recorded, so this spell can’t be used to create a backup copy of a scroll even as it’s read by the wizard, but a clever wizard may be able to record a magical item’s command word if an enemy within range uses it while the spell is in effect. The material component for this spell is the blank page, scroll, or paper that the dictation will appear on. This must be prepared with a special wash of vinegar, which brings the cost to 10 gold pieces per page so readied."

He developed this spell early in his career to assist him in his frequent and precipitous withdrawals from combat. When cast, expeditious retreat provides the wizard with an amazing fleetness of foot, enabling him to run in great leaps and bounds. The caster’s movement rate is tripled for the duration of the spell, so a wizard with a movement of 12 would be able to run at a rate of 36 while the spell was in effect. In addition, the wizard can jump up to 5 feet in the air or make a 15-foot horizontal leap with ease. The wizard does not have to move while the spell is in effect, but if he moves at all, his unnatural speed and bounds prevent him from taking any other actions except for running—in other words, he can’t take a half-move and throw a missile, or charge, cast a spell, or do anything else except move. The wizard cannot increase his movement further by any means, including additional movement-affecting magical spells or items. Kerith was also noted for his cynical observation to a companion: “I don’t have to outrun the troll. I just have to outrun you."

Any attacks that require physical contact (bites, stings, claws, etc.) automatically fail, but a creature with a ranged attack can still attack the spell’s recipient. The spell ends if the recipient attacks a creature he has been protected against, or tries to pin or trap the vermin by forcing the repelling barrier against them.

Alert and well-rested characters suddenly become tired and sluggish, and characters who are already fatigued may be reduced to near-helplessness. In effect, the ray adds one level of fatigue or encumbrance to the victim. Moderately encumbered characters suffer a –1 penalty to attack rolls; heavily encumbered characters suffer a –2 penalty to attacks rolls and a +1 Armor Class penalty; and severely encumbered characters suffer a –4 penalty to attack rolls and a +3 Armor Class penalty. (Assume that monsters suffer a –1 penalty to their attack rolls and reduce their movement rates by 33%.) The victim is allowed a saving throw to negate the spell’s effects. If you are using the fatigue rules from the Player’s Option™: Combat & Tactics book, this spell operates in a slightly different manner—fresh characters become fatigued, gaining one level of encumbrance; fatigued characters become exhausted, gaining two levels of encumbrance; and exhausted characters collapse in a quivering heap, unable to move or attack."

If the form selected has wings, the wizard can actually fly, but at only one-third the speed of a true creature of that type, and with a loss of two maneuverability classes (to a minimum of E). If the form has gills, the caster can breathe under water as long as the spell lasts. However, the caster does not gain any multiple attack routines or additional damage allowed to an assumed form.

The rope can only enwrap a creature or an object within 1 foot of it--it does not snakeoutward--so it must be thrown or hurled near the intended target.

Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell, it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. When cast at a creature, the target gets a saving throw vs. spell; success indicates that the spell affects the space about 1 footbehind the creature instead. Note that this spell can also blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs, reducing its attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class by 4. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. A continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of continual light against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both. This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in the typical campaign.

A finely sewn gown or robe of high-quality material (at least 50 gp value) is fashioned so as to contain numerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is the minimum number. The deeppockets spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (5 cubic feet in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, the caster can instead choose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (_ cubic foot volume each). If the robe or like garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets (200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be created to contain one pound of weight and 1/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special pocket is actually an extradimensional holding space. If the spell duration expires while there is material within the enchanted pockets, or if a successful dispel magic is cast upon the enchanted garment, all the material suddenly appears around the wearer and immediately falls to the ground. The caster can also cause all the pockets to empty with a single command. In addition to the garment, which is reusable, the material components of this spell are a tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth given a half-twist and fastened at the ends."

    "Description": "This spell discovers emanations of evil (or of good in the case of the reverse spell) from any creature, object, or area. Character alignment is not revealed under most circumstances: Characters who are strongly aligned, do not stray from their faith, and who are at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if they are intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enables them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not. The degree of evil (faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming) can be noted. Note that priests have a more powerful version of this spell. The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide and 60 yards long in the direction in which the wizard is facing. The wizard must concentrate--stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura--for at least one round to receive a reading."

The ESP is stopped by 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead foil. The wizard employing the spell is able to probe the surface thoughts of one creature per round, getting simple instinctual thoughts from lower order creatures. Probes can continue on the same creature from round to round or can move on to other creatures. The caster can use the spell to help determine if a creature lurks behind a door, for example, but the ESP does not always reveal what sort of creature it is. If used as part of a program of interrogation, an intelligent and wary subject receives an initial saving throw. If successful, the creature successfully resists and the spell reveals no additional information. If the saving throw is failed, the caster may learn additional information, according to the DM's ruling. The creature's Wisdom adjustment applies, as may additional bonuses up to +4, based on the sensitivity of the information sought. The material component of this spell is a copper piece."

The DM may adjust the saving throws if there is little or no room to dodge the sphere. The sphere moves as long as the spellcaster actively directs it; otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by the same means as any normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push unwilling creatures aside or batter down large obstacles. The material components are a bit of tallow, a pinch of sulphur, and a dusting of powdered iron."

As a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of any size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot cube per caster level. The fog obscures all sight, normal and infravision, beyond 2 feet. As a cloudkill-like fog, this is a billowing mass of ghastly, yellowish-green vapors, measuring 40 feet x 20 feet x 20 feet. This moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round. The vapors are heavier than air and sink to the lowest level, even pouring down sinkholes and den openings. Very thick vegetation breaks up the fog after it has moved 20 feet into the vegetation. The only effect of either version is to obscure vision. A strong breeze will disperse either effect in one round, while a moderate breeze will reduce the spell duration by 50%. The spell cannot be cast under water."

The area of effect is 10 cubic inches per level--i.e., a 1-inch x 1-inch x 10-inch volume or equivalent, equal to about 150 gold coins. Any creature viewing the \"gold\" is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell, which can be modified by the creature's Wisdom; for every level of the wizard, the creature must subtract 1 from his dice roll. Thus, it is unlikely that fools' gold will be detected if createdby a high-level caster. If the \"gold\" is struck hard by an object of cold-wrought iron, there is a slight chance it will revert to its natural state, depending on the material component used to create the \"gold.\" If a 25-gp citrine is powdered and sprinkled over the metal as this spell is cast, the chance that cold iron will return it to its true nature is 30%; if a 50- gp amber stone is powdered and used, the chance drops to 25%; if a 250-gp topaz is powdered and used, the chance drops to 10%; and if a 500-gp oriental (corundum) topaz is powdered and used, there is only a 1% chance that the cold iron will reveal that it is fools' gold."

Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Note, however, that light never becomes invisible, although a source of lightcan become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first. Note that the priest spells bless, chant, and prayer are not attacks for this purpose. All highly Intelligent (Intelligence 13 or more) creatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels of experience have a chance to detect invisible objects (they roll saving throws vs. spell; success means they noticed the invisible object).

Creatures with very thick or insensitive skins (such as buffalo, elephants, scaled creatures, etc.) are basically unaffected. There are two versions of the spell, either of which can be cast from the standard preparation: Itching. When cast, this causes each subject to feel an instant itching sensation on some portion of its body. If one round is not immediately spent scratching the irritated area, the creature is so affected that the next three rounds are spent squirming and twisting, effectively worsening its Armor Class by 4 and its attack rolls by 2 during this time. Spell preparations are ruined in the first round this spell is in effect, but not in the following three rounds. Doing nothing but scratching the itch for a full round prevents the rest of the effect. If cast at one creature, the saving throw has a -3 penalty; if cast at two creatures, the saving throw has a -1 penalty; and if cast at three or four creatures, the saving throw is normal. Rash. When a rash is cast, the subject notices nothing for 1d4 rounds, but thereafter its entire skin breaks out in red welts that itch. The rash persists until either a cure disease or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. It lowers Charisma by 1 point per day for each of four days (i.e., maximum Charisma loss is 4 points). After one week, Dexterity is lowered by 1 point also. Symptoms vanish immediately upon the removal of the rash, and all statistics return to normal. This can be cast at one creature only, with a saving throw penalty of -2. The material component for this spell is a leaf from poison ivy, oak, or sumac."

It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains. If used to open a wizard-locked door, the spell does not remove the former spell, but simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In all other cases, it permanently opens locks or welds--although the former could be closed and locked again later. It does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Note that the effect is limited by the area; a 3rd-level wizard can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-ft. x 7-ft. door). Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or triple locked, opening it requires two knock spells. In all cases, the location of the door or item must be known--the spell cannot be used against a wall in hopes of discovering a secret door. The reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a door or similar closure, provided there is a physical mechanism. It does not create a weld, but it locks physically operated locking mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to two functions. It cannot affect a portcullis."

If the spell is cast upon the wizard, he can move vertically up or down at a movement rate of 2 per round. If cast upon an object or another creature, the wizard can levitate it at the same speed, according to his command. This spell does not empower horizontal movement, but the recipient could push along the face of a cliff, for example, to move laterally. The spellcaster can cancel the spell as desired.

Once cast, the spell requires no concentration, except when changing height. A levitating creature attempting to use a missile weapon finds himself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of -1, the second -2, the third -3, etc., up to a maximum of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1. Lack of leverage makes it impossible to cock a medium or heavy crossbow.

The message, which must be of 25 words or less, can be in any language known by the spellcaster, and can be delivered over a period of one turn. The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words. It does, however, move to the words articulated-- if it is placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. Some examples are to speak \"to the first creature that touches you,\" or \"to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.\" Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: \"Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.\" Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards (\"Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.\"). The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.

While the detection spell functions, it indicates the wrong area, creature, or the opposite of the truth with respect to detect evil or detect lie. The wizard directs the spell effect upon the object of the detection spell. If the caster of the detection spell fails his saving throw vs. spell, the misdirection takes place. Note that this spell does not affect other types of divination (know alignment, augury, ESP, clairvoyance, etc.)."

The spell protects the caster, or one item or person that he touches (such as a spell book or a drawer containing spell components). Any cantrip cast against the protected person or item dissipates with an audible popping sound. This spell is often used by a wizard who has mischievous apprentices, or one who wishes apprentices to clean or shine an area using elbow grease rather than magic. Any unwilling target of this spell must be touched (via an attack roll) and is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to escape the effect."

First, it can produce a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks that lasts one round. This effect temporarily blinds those creatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the area and that have an unobstructed line of sight to the burst. Creatures viewing this are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds unless they successfully save vs. spell. The fireworks fill a volume 10 times greater than that of the original fire source. This spell can also cause a thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster. This covers a roughly spherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source. All within the cloud must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or suffer -2 penalties to all combat rolls and Armor Class. The spell uses one fire source within a 20-foot cube, which is immediately extinguished. An extremely large fire used as a source might be only partially extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1 point of damage per caster level."

The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space. The spellcaster and up to seven others can climb up the rope and disappear into this place of safety where no creature can find them. The rope can be taken into the extradimensional space if fewer than eight persons have climbed it; otherwise, it simply stays hanging in the air (extremely strong creatures might be able to remove it, at the DM's option). Spells cannot be cast across the interdimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if there were a 3-foot x 5-foot window centered on the rope. The persons in the extradimensional space must climb down prior to the end of the spell, or they are dropped from the height at which they entered the extradimensional space. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. Note that the rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space. Also note that creating or taking extradimensional spaces into an existing extradimensional space is hazardous. The material components of this spell are powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment."

The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 2 hit points per caster level from these attacks. A protection from evil spell keeps the swarm at bay, and certain area-effect spells, such as gust of wind and stinking cloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if appropriate to the swarm summoned (for example, only flyers are affected by a gust of wind).

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points--floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc.--or the web collapses upon itself and disappears. The web spell covers a maximum area of eight 10-foot x 10-foot x 10-foot cubes and the webs must be at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, two things may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape the area, then it is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape, then the webs are only half strength. Creatures with less than 13 Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are stuck until freed by another or until the spell wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs. Creatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through 1 foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break through 2 feet of webs per round. If the webs are at half strength, these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates to great strength in this case, and creatures of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures can break through 10 feet of webs per round. Furthermore, the strands of a web spell are flammable. A magical flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire--torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc.--can set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within flaming webs suffer 2d4 points of damage from the flames, but those free of the strands are not harmed. The material component of this spell is a bit of spider web."

The whispering wind can travel as many miles above ground as the spellcaster has levels of experience, to a specific location within range that is familiar to the wizard. The whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. The wizard can prepare the spell to bear a message of up to 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for one round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air that has a susurrant sound. He can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as a mile per hour or as quickly as a mile per turn.

After several wild mages destroyed themselves by rather spectacular means (or suffered very odd side effects), the chaos shield was created as protection from these surges. This spell imbues the wild mage with special protection against the effects of wild surges. It protects only against wild surges caused by the caster's own spells, not from the effects of another mage's wild surges. When a wild surge affects a caster protected by chaos shield, he is allowed a saving throw vs. magic. If the saving throw is successful, the effect of the surge on the caster is negated. If the saving throw is failed, the caster is affected normally by the surge. The spell does not protect against wild surges that might be caused by its own casting. The chaos shield protects only the caster and does not negate the effects of a wild surge for other characters who might be in the area of effect. The caster cannot voluntarily cancel the protection once he has learned the nature of a wild surge; the chaos shield protects from both good and harmful effects. Thus, if a wild surge resulted in a heal spell for all characters within 10 feet of the caster, the protected caster might not benefit, while all others in the radius would be healed. The spell remains in effect until it negates a wild surge or the spell duration expires."

The caster designates the position of the shell (protecting the front, rear, side, or top of the recipient). The spell does not protect against area effect spells or other attacks that strike several creatures at once. Whenever an individual missile attack is directed at a protected creature, the baneful deflector activates. Instead of striking the target creature, the missile's target is determined randomly among all creatures within a 15-foot hemisphere of the protected creature, including the protected creature. The missile then changes course toward its new target with normal chances to hit. If the new target is beyond the range of the missile, no target is hit.

The earthen arm and hand (which are about the same size as a normal human limb) arise from the ground beneath one creature targeted by the caster. The hand attempts to grasp the creature's leg. The victim must attempt a saving throw; if successful, the hand sinks into the ground. Each round thereafter (until the spell ends or the target moves out of spell range), the hand has a 5% chance per level of the caster of reappearing beneath the targeted creature, at which time another saving throw is required. If a saving throw is missed, the earthen limb firmly grasps and holds the creature in place. An individual held by the hand suffers a movement rate of 0, Armor Class penalty of -2, and attack penalty of -2. All Dexterity combat bonuses are negated. The hand causes no physical damage to the victim. The arm may be attacked by any creature, including the arm's victim. The arm has AC 5 and hit points equal to double the caster's maximum hit points. For example, a caster who normally has 15 hit points can create an earthen hand with 30 hit points. The maximum number of hit points that an earthen hand may have is 40. When the arm's hit points are reduced to zero or when the spell duration ends, the hand crumbles.

Affected creatures can control their altitude by rising or descending at a movement rate of 12, but are at the mercy of the wind for speed and direction. Recipients can stop forward movement only by grasping something to anchor them in place. If no wind is present, this spell has no effect. Unwilling targets are allowed a saving throw to resist the effect. Each subject and his equipment must weigh less than 100 pounds per level of the caster. Thus, a 6th-level wizard could affect six creatures each weighing 600lbs. or less. This spell may be cast only on living creatures. The material components are a small handful of straw and a dry leaf."

The caster makes a normal attack roll as if attacking with a missile weapon, factoring in the range from the attacker to the target (the ice knife has a long range of 30 yards, a medium range of 20 yards, and a short range of 10 yards). A successful hit causes 2-8 (2d4) hit points of damage. If the ice knife misses its target, consult the rules for grenade-like missiles on pages 62-63 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine where it lands. When an ice knife strikes a solid object or a creature, the knife shatters, releasing a wave of numbing cold. All creatures within a 5-foot radius must make a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or suffer 1-4 hit points of cold damage and become numb for 1-3 rounds. Numbed creatures have their movement rates reduced by half and their chance to hit reduced by 2. Proximity to major sources of heat, such as a roaring bonfire, improves a creature's saving throw by +2. An ice knife that misses or is lost cannot be picked up by the caster (or anyone else) and thrown again. If the ice knife is touched, it instantly shatters, releasing a wave of cold as described above. If a lost ice knife is not touched, it melts away in a pool of water 1 round after it was originally created; this melting occurs regardless of the environmental temperature. The material components for this spell are a drop of water from melted snow and a tiny silver dagger."

It has no beneficial effect if cast on skeletal remains or on previously animated undead. Thus preserved, a corpse permanently retains the same odor and appearance it had at the time of casting. Embalm does not reverse the effects of putrefaction, but it does prevent any further decay of an individual's physical remains.

    "Description": "With this spell, a wizard establishes a sensory link between him- or herself and any living creature within range. If the wizard knows a specific creature or person within range, then the spell can take effect on that specific creature. Otherwise, the living link will be established with any sentient creature within range, determined randomly. Similar to the 1st-level spell corpse link (which only works with fresh cadavers and zombies), living link allows the caster to gather sensory information from the vicinity of the targeted creature (sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch). For every four levels of experience past the 1st, the wizard can collect information from an additional sense (up to two senses at 5th level, three at 9th, four at 13th, and all five at the 17th level of experience). The target creature of this spell experiences nothing to indicate that its senses have been tapped, and it remains in control of its own actions, entirely unaware of the magical connection to the wizard. In other words, the wizard cannot force the subject to look at something (listen at a keyhole, taste a glass of wine, pick up an object, and so on). This spell merely enables the wizard to directly experience the world through another creature's perceptions. For instance, looking through another creature's eyes gives the wizard all of its visual capabilities, like infravision should the creature have that ability. While the spell is in effect, the living link overrides the wizard's own sensory perceptions. Thus, while a wizard is seeing through another creature's eyes, he or she is unable to see through his or her own. The spell can be ended early with no risk to the caster."

    "Description": "By casting this spell, a wizard animates a pair of skeletal hands that levitate in midair and move as directed by the caster, who uses verbal commands and somatic gestures to guide them. The hands can perform only simple grasping, lifting, and carrying activities. They cannot perform complex movements that require great dexterity, such as picking locks. They can, however, open unlocked doors and chests, or turn pages in a spell book. The hands can also make two clawing attacks per round, each attack directed against a different target. They attack using the wizard's table at the same level as the spellcaster, and each inflicts 1-3 hp damage on a successful hit. The hands may be physically attacked in turn (each hand has AC 5, hp 4, and MV 6) and may move anywhere within their range. The hands can carry up to 5 pounds each; together, they can carry an object of up to 20 pounds. The hands may wield weapons within these weight limits. When using weapons, the skeletal hands attack on the wizard's combat table, with a level half that of the spellcaster and with applicable penalties for nonproficiency. Handheld melee weapons do half their normal damage (round up fractions), because the hands cannot generate the proper forces that the weapons need in order to inflict normal damage. The hands may fire an already loaded crossbow and inflict normal damage, because the crossbow provides the necessary force to propel the bolt. All other missile weapons have their ranges reduced to one quarter and inflict their normal damage (round up fractions). The material components are the complete, skeletal hands of any human, demihuman, or humanoid. These hand bones may be reused in multiple castings of the spell, providing the hands have not been damaged or destroyed in combat."

The spell cannot be used to transcribe magical runes, signs, glyphs, or symbols, but as many as seven letters or marks can be drawn.

In addition to appearing when the proper conditions are met, a moon rune also becomes visible if a detect magic, detect invisibility, true seeing, or other such spell or effect is used on it.

The spell recipient can still be poisoned by a spitting attack or a thrown dagger smeared with poison. If the spell recipient attacks a creature he has been warded against or uses the resistance of the spell’s aura to force his antagonist to give ground, the spell ends.

    "Description": "By means of this spell, the wizard causes his material form to \"blink\" directly from one point to another at a random time and in a random direction. This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after he has blinked. Each round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of theblink--the result of the dice roll is used as the wizard's initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from his previous position. (Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. Movable objects of size and mass comparable to the caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks in. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal Plane. During each round that he blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (for example, with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster. If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to his normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus, he probably attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try to get his attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are not added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. If his blink roll is lower than his initiative roll, however, he blinks first and then attacks in whatever direction he's facing (he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone)."

Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in thearea of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell). Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled. A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature's saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword. Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM's option. Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions."

The explosive runes are difficult to detect--5% chance per level of magic use experience of the reader; thieves have only a 5% chance.

A like amount, or half that if saving throws are made, is suffered by each creature within the blast radius. The wizard who cast the spell, as well as any he instructs, can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, the wizard can remove the runes whenever desired. Others can remove them only with a successful dispel magic or erase spell. Explosive runes otherwise last until the spell is triggered.

Although the person or creature affected by the feign death spell can smell, hear, and know what is going on, no feeling or sight of any sort is possible. Thus, any wounding or mistreatment of the body is not felt and no reaction occurs; damage is only half normal. In addition, paralysis, poison, and energy- level drain cannot affect an individual under the influence of this spell. Poison injected or otherwise introduced into the body takes effect when the spell recipient is no longer under the influence of this spell, although a saving throw is permitted. Note that only a willing individual can be affected by a feign death spell.

    "Description": "A fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it--1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The burst of the fireball creates little pressure and generally conforms to the shape of the area in which it occurs. The fireball fills an area equal to its normal spherical volume (roughly 33,000 cubic feet--thirty-three 10-foot x 10-foot x 10-foot cubes). Besides causing damage to creatures, the fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the fireball melts soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items require saving throws vs. magical fire to determine if they are affected, but items in the possession of a creature that rolls a successful saving throw are unaffected by the fireball. The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage (the DM rolls the damage and each affected creature suffers either full damage or half damage [round fractions down], depending on whether the creature saved or not). The material component of this spell is a tiny ball of bat guano and sulphur."

The missiles must be nocked and drawn (or cocked) at the completion of the spell. If they are not loosed within one round, they are consumed by the magic. For every five levels the caster has achieved, up to 10 arrows or bolts can be affected. The arrows inflict normal damage, plus 1 point of fire damage to any target struck. They may also cause incendiary damage. This version of the spell is used most often in large battles. The second version of this spell enables the caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents within range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage, plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck successfully saves vs. spell. The caster receives one bolt for every five experience levels (two bolts at 10th level, three at 15th level, etc.). Bolts must be used on creatures within 20 yards of each other and in front of the wizard. The material components for this spell are a drop of oil and a small piece of flint."

It also fans large fires outward 1d6 feet in the direction of the wind's movement. It forces back small flying creatures 1d6 x 10 yards and causes man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting to move against its force. It slows larger-than-man-sized flying creatures by 50% for one round. It blows over light objects, disperses most vapors, and forces away gaseous or unsecured levitating creatures. Its path is a constant 10 feet wide, by 10 yards long per level of experience of the caster (for example, an 8th-level wizard causes a gust of wind that travels 80 yards).

If the spell is cast at only one person, the saving throw suffers a - 3 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those succeeding on their saving throws are unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. Held beings cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.

Only the person (or people) who the wizard desires to read the writing can do so. An illusionist recognizes it for illusionary script. Unauthorized creatures glancing at the script must roll saving throws vs. spell. A successful save means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by the caster at the time the illusionary script spell was cast. The suggestion cannot require more than three turns to carry out. The suggestion could be to close the book and leave, or to forget the existence of the book, for example. A successful dispel magic spell will remove the illusionary script, but an unsuccessful attempt erases all of the writing. The hidden writings can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell and either the read magic or comprehend languages spell, as applicable.

Half of the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. Up to seven other man-sized creatures can fit into the field with its creator; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if the spellcaster removes himself from the hut, the spell dissipates. The temperature inside the hut is 70 F., if the exterior temperature is between 0 and 100 F. An exterior temperature below 0 or above 100 lowers or raises, respectively, the interior temperature on a 1 -for-1 basis. The tiny hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, sandstorms, and the like. The hut can withstand any wind of less than hurricane force without being harmed, but wind force greater than that destroys it. The interior of the hut is a hemisphere; the spellcaster can illuminate it dimly upon command, or extinguish the light as desired. Note that although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut. The hut can be dispelled.

    "Description": "Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum damage per level of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (for example, if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of the bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40). The lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to a half-foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). Saving throws must be rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke (see the fireball spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues. A bolt can breach 1 inch of wood or half an inch of stone per caster level, up to a maximum of 1 foot of wood or half a foot of stone. The lightning bolt's area of effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt 5 feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier toward its caster, ending only when it reaches its full length. For example: An 80-foot-long stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and so is caught in his own lightning bolt!). The DM might allow reflecting bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes a solid surface, the bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than once by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is crossed, but it still suffers either full damage (if one saving throw is missed) or half damage (if all saving throws are made). The material components of the spell are a bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass rod."

It can also ignite combustible materials (even solid planks). The meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with no penalty for range. Misses are treated as grenadelike missiles that inflict 1 point of damage to creatures within 3 feet. The spell can be cast in either of two ways: A) The wizard discharges five meteors every round (see the \"Multiple Attacks and Initiative\" section in Chapter 9: Combat). Note that this carries over into at least the following round. B) The wizard discharges only one meteor per round. In addition to releasing the missile, the caster can perform other actions in the round, including spellcasting, melee, or device use. Spells requiring concentration force the wizard to forgo the rest of the missiles to maintain concentration. Also, if the wizard fails to maintain an exact mental count of the number of missiles he has remaining, he has involuntarily lost the remaining portion of the spell. The spell ends when the caster has fired off as many meteors as he has experience levels, when he forgoes casting any still remaining, or when a successful dispel magic spell is thrown upon the caster. The components necessary for the casting of this spell are nitre and sulphur formed into a bead by the addition of pine tar. The caster must also have a small hollow tube of minute proportion, fashioned from gold. The tube costs no less than 1,000 gp to construct, so fine is its workmanship and magical engraving, and it can be reused."

Note, however, that the mount cannot casually take off and fly; the movement must be between points of similar altitude. 14th Level: The ability to perform as if it were a pegasus; it flies at a rate of 48 per round upon command. Note that a mount's abilities include those of lower levels; thus, a 12th-level mount has the 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-level abilities."

Its attack is made as if it were a monster with Hit Dice equal to the level of the wizard who cast the spell. If it strikes successfully, the victim is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force, frozen and immobilized until released, either at the caster's command, by a successful dispel magic spell, or until a time equal to 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level has elapsed. Until then, nothing can get at the victim, move the shimmering force surrounding him, or otherwise affect him. The victim does not age, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells while in this state. He is not aware of his surroundings. If the sepia snake misses its target, it dissipates in a flash of brown light, with a loud noise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that is 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one round. The spell cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove it; an erase spell destroys the entire page of text. It can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text. The components for the spell are 100 gp worth of powdered amber, a scale from any snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores."

The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the wizard's suggestion--it must be spoken in a language that the spell recipient understands. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizard's party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power. The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, the action will not be performed. If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect. Note that a very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the DM. Undead are not subject to suggestion. The material components of this spell are a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil."

The information instantly appears in the caster's mind but may be lost if the wizard cannot comprehend it. The caster must roll an Intelligence check; if successful, the wizard understands the formula and retains it in his memory. If the roll is missed, the caster cannot comprehend what he has learned and the information is immediately forgotten. If the spell is cast a second time on the same substance, the spell automatically fails unless the wizard has advanced to the next experience level. The caster's level determines the type of information gleaned: 5th Level: The type and quantity of ingredients and the preparation process required to produce a non-magical mixture are learned. For example, the wizard could learn how to produce Greek fire or gunpowder, or could learn the recipe for something simple, like chocolate cake. 9th Level: The wizard may learn the proper ingredients and formula for making a magical liquid (potion, scroll ink, etc.). 14th Level: The caster may learn the formula for creating any type of magical object, excluding unique items and objects of extreme power (artifacts and relics). In all cases, simply knowing the proper formula does not mean the wizard can successfully create the item or material. The construction of alchemical mixtures and magical items is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking. This spell has detrimental effects on the magical item analyzed. Single-use items (potions, oils, etc.) are automatically destroyed; the spell consumes the item in the process of analyzing it. Reusable magical items must make a saving throw vs. disintegration. If the saving throw is failed, Alamir's fundamental breakdown releases the magic of the item in an explosive blast, rendering it permanently nonmagical. The caster suffers 4d8 points of damage from the explosion. The material component is a wand cut from a 100-year-old oak tree. The wand is used to touch the item in question, and vanishes in a puff of smoke when the spell is complete."

The caster must maintain concentration or the spell fails. The flames can be spread at the rate of 50 square feet per turn. Thus, if a caster affects a campfire, he could create a flaming line 1 foot wide and 50 feet long or fill a 5' 0 10' square in a single round. The flames are not limited by a lack of burnable material and can be directed to spread over water, snow, ice, and other nonflammable surfaces.

    "Description": "This spell may be cast on any body of liquid as large as an ocean or as small as a glass of wine. The first creature whose reflection is cast on the surface of the liquid releases the spell. When the spell is triggered, the liquid immediately forms an exact three-dimensional image of the reflected creature. If more than one creature casts a reflection simultaneously, only one watery double forms. Each creature has an equal chance of being the victim of the spell (roll randomly). The size of the watery double is restricted by the volume of fluid available. If the spell were cast on a full mug of ale, the double would form from the ale, becoming a mug-sized duplicate of the victim. The watery double will never exceed the actual size of the victim regardless of the size of the body of liquid. When the spell is cast on the liquid, its duration is considered permanent until the power is released by a creature's reflection. The liquid will not evaporate until the spell is triggered. When the watery double forms, it remains animated for 1 round per experience level of the caster, to a maximum of 10 rounds. The watery double attempts to touch the creature it has duplicated. It can affect only the creature that it resembles. It has the same THAC0 and current hit points as the creature it duplicates, but cannot cast spells or use any of the creature's magical items or special abilities. The watery double is AC 6 and its movement rate is double that of the victim. It may seep under doors and through cracks. If the watery double succeeds in touching the creature, it merges with the individual, covering his entire body in a skin of liquid. The victim must attempt a saving throw. If successful, the creature has resisted the spell's effect and the watery double \"dies,\" becoming normal fluid (and soaking the creature in the process). If the saving throw is failed, the watery double begins forcing its way into the victim's body, inflicting 1d8 points of damage per round until it is destroyed. The watery double dissipates if reduced to zero hit points or when the spell's duration expires. Striking the watery double while it is wrapped around its victim causes an equal amount of damage to the victim. Part water, lower water, and transmute water to dust"

Only the auras of those things normally visible to the caster are seen; this spell does not grant the wizard the ability to see invisible objects, nor does it give him X-ray vision. This spell does not reveal the presence of good or evil or reveal alignment. While wizard sight is in effect, a wizard is able to see whether someone is a spellcaster and whether that person is a priest or a wizard (and what type of specialist, if any). He can sense if a nonspellcaster has the potential to learn and cast wizard spells (e.g., whether a fighter will someday gain the ability to cast a spell). Although a spellcaster's level cannot be discerned, the wizard can see the intensity of a spellcaster's aura and guess at the individual's magical power (dim, faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming). This can be extremely ambiguous even when a wizard has some method of comparison; the DM might announce that a subject's intensity is roughly equivalent to that of a companion, or he might announce that a subject's aura is the strongest the wizard has ever encountered. An object's magical abilities cannot be discerned. The fact that it is magical and the type of magic (abjuration, alteration, etc.) are obvious. The wizard can see the intensity of an item's magical aura and guess at its power, but cannot tell whether a magical item is cursed."

A deceased subject previously under the effect of delay death can be raised normally by raise dead and similar spells.

If the caster stops moving and concentrates, he can mentally command the hovering skull to move in any direction within a 30- foot radius. The caster can see through the skull's eyes as if they were his own; for instance, the hovering skull could be ordered to investigate a dark cave or peek over a high wall. Additionally, the caster can order the hovering skull to attack victims with its razor-sharp teeth. If the caster's concentration is interrupted while controlling the skull, the skull immediately drops to the ground (but it takes no damage). If the caster resumes concentration, he can continue to command the skull. The hovering skull has the same statistics as the caster, except the skull has 3 hit points and inflicts 1-6 hit points of damage with its bite. Attacks directed at the skull do not harm the caster, nor does damage directed at the caster affect the skull. The material component for this spell is the tooth from a human skull."

    "Description": "A variation of the armor spell, this spell enables the caster to cover his body with an invisible suit of plate mail to temporarily raise his AC to 3. Its effects are not cumulative with other armor or magical protection (a character cannot improve his AC better than 3 through use of this spell), but Dexterity bonuses still apply. For each level of the caster, the invisible mail absorbs 1 hit point of damage that would normally hit AC 3; however, the invisible mail offers no protection against magical weapons or attacks. When the invisible mail has absorbed as many hit points of damage as the wizard has levels of experience, the invisible mail disappears. The invisible mail does not hinder movement, nor does it add weight or encumbrance. It does not interfere with spell casting. Example: A wizard with a normal AC of 10 has shielded himself with invisible mail. The first opponent attacks with a normal dagger; the attack is made against the AC 3 of the invisible mail. The attack is successful, causing 2 hit points of damage, but this damage is absorbed by the invisible mail and the wizard is unharmed. A second attack is made with a sword +1. The invisible armor offers no protection against this magical weapon, so the attack is made against the wizard's normal AC of 10. The material component is a small fragment of plate mail."

The pain causes no damage, but for the next 1-4 rounds, the victim will be -2 on his chance to hit and his AC is worsened by 2. The caster can cast the spell and touch the victim in the same round.

The snapping teeth are contained in a mouth-like orifice about 6 inches in diameter and are capable of snapping at victims within 1 foot. A person or creature with the snapping teeth can cause them to snap at will, effectively giving him an extra attack per round. A normal attack roll is made, and a successful hit inflicts 1-4 hit points of damage. Note that the victim must be within range of the teeth and that normal facing considerations must be accounted for (for instance, snapping teeth in the back of a person's head can only attack victims that are behind the person). Snapping teeth can also be placed on a non-living object, such as a tree or a door. In such cases, the snapping teeth are invisible until they make an attack. The snapping teeth will attack any victim that comes within 1 foot; they attack as a 4 HD monster, and each successful hit causes 1-4 hit points of damage. These attacks are automatic and are not controlled by the caster. Attacks cannot be directed against the snapping teeth, but dispel magic causes them to vanish.

    "Duration": "3 turns/level",
    "Description": "This spell temporarily animates the physical remains of a human, demihuman, or humanoid. Bone dance forges a mystical link with the newly made undead creature, enabling the caster to mentally control its movements, just as a master puppeteer manipulates the actions of a wooden puppet. The skeleton or zombie animated by this spell is incapable of carrying out any independent actions the wizard mustmentally command his or her undead puppet to walk forward, pick up a sword, strike an opponent with it, and so on. While the caster concentrates on maintaining the bone dance, he or she may not speak, cast other spells, or actively engage in melee. The spell occupies the greater part of the caster's attention. The skeleton or zombie created by this spell conforms to the normal variety described in the MM. It is compatible with (can be affected by) other necromantic spells that affect undead, and the creature may perform all of the simple actions outlined in the skeletal hands spell. If directed into combat, it fights as a regular skeleton (even if it still has some flesh on its bones). When combined with spectral voice, bone dance can make for an effective decoy, a menacing bluff, or at least a ghastly form of entertainment. When augmented by corpse link, a dancing cadaver may serve as an effective (and ultimately expendable) scout that can work beyond the immediate visual range of the caster. Normally, the bone dance progresses for the duration of the spell or until the caster loses concentration. The dance also ends prematurely if the caster causes the skeleton to move beyond spell range or out of direct sight (certain divinations, such as corpse link or clairvoyance, may lift this hindrance). The bone dance may be destroyed in combat, or broken by a successful dispel magic. The material component is an intact skeleton or corpse and a small, crude puppet which the caster must manipulate with both hands to choreograph the bone dance."

The wizard gains the facial features of the chosen individual of either sex, providing the subject lies within range and the caster can clearly see the face he or she is trying to emulate. The caster does not gain any sensory abilities (or disabilities) associated with the new face. For example, if the caster copies a blind man's face, the wizard still retains his or her normal sight. The caster retains his or her normal voice, too, as well as height, bodily appearance, spells, and spell-like abilities. The false face serves as an effective disguise, though it radiates a magical aura of necromancy. Spells that detect or banish illusions have no effect on this disguise; the false face is not illusionary. It may be reversed with dispel magic. The material components are a small ball of natural rubber and a small mirror, both of which are consumed in the casting."

The skulltrap remains dormant until the skull is touched by living matter or is struck and damaged by non-living matter (for instance, it's struck by in combat or falls to the floor). Assume a normal skull is AC 8 and has 2 hp. This simple warding does not discriminate; it can just as easily be triggered by the wizard who cast the spell as by a curious rat brushing up against it. When the skulltrap discharges, the skull flashes briefly with red or violet light and violently explodes, releasing a blast of energy drawn from the Negative Material plane. The burst of negative energy does 2d4 hp damage plus ld4 hp damage for every level of the caster. All living creatures within 10' of the skull must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon to suffer only half damage from the blast. Because the trap is so easily triggered, the skull is often placed in its final resting place before casting the spell on it. The trapped skull may be moved without triggering the trap, but it must be moved very slowly and without contact with living matter. Cloves or any other thin materials used to cover the flesh of a living being arc not enough to prevent the skulltrap from being discharged. The material component is a pinch of dust from the physical remains of a corporeal undead being with strong ties to the Negative Material Plane, such as a wight or vampire."

The spell causes a number of shining metal bands to materialize out of the air, encircling and capturing a target of the caster’s choice. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to elude capture, with a –1 penalty per three caster levels (for example, –1 for a 4th to 6th level caster, –2 for a 7th to 9th level caster, –3 for a 10th to 12th level caster, and so on), since higher-level casters tend to conjure more bands in a denser pattern. Any creature of less than size G (gargantuan) can be snared, but gargantuan monsters are simply too big to be restrained by the bands. If the victim fails his saving throw vs. spell, he is caught and held immobile by the bands. He may not move his arms and legs, but he is still capable of speech and can employ psionic powers or use worn magical items, such as rings. Subjects with a Strength rating may attempt to burst the bands and free themselves with a bend bars/lift gates roll. If the subject does not have a strength rating, it may make a saving throw vs. petrification with a –4 penalty. The spell requires three miniature bands of silver that are interlocked so that all three are connected."

Victims are allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage. The lance’s energy delivers a powerful blow against inanimate objects and can easily blast light furniture, thin wooden walls, or fragile stonework to flinders. Barred wooden doors can be blasted of their hinges and even sturdy iron-bound doors or heavy stonework can be seriously damaged by the lance of disruption.

The duration of this spell is either one day per level of the caster or until discharged, whichever happens first. The exact form of energy is chosen by the caster when he creates the lesser sign; acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic disruption are popular choices. The sign is not hidden or concealed in any way and is usually quite prominent on the item or portal it protects. The caster cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the lesser sign’s operation; it functions against any creature that attempts to pass it (except for extraplanar creatures of 6 HD or more and wizards of higher level than the caster—they can merely ignore it as if it were not there). The sign cannot be dispelled by spells of lower spell levels such as knock, but the caster can remove it any time he chooses, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated by an erase spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster. The material component for a lesser sign can be a pinch of either powdered diamond (cold), ruby (fire), emerald (acid), pearl (sonic disruption, or sapphire (electricity), depending on the type of energy the wizard wishes the sign to employ.

Up to one square foot of surface area per caster level can be affected, so a 5th-level caster can affect 5 square feet—enough to create a 2-foot by 3-foot hole in a door or wall, or thoroughly drench a man-sized creature. The acid eats through 6 inches of wood, leather, or bone, 4 inches of stone, or 1 inch of metal each round. Against monsters composed of stone, metal, or wood, the solvent inflicts 1d3 points of damage per caster level per square foot affected in the first round, 1d2 per caster level in the second round, and 1 per two caster levels in the third and final round. Therefore, a 10th-level wizard who strikes a treant with solvent of corrosion inflicts 10d3, then 10d2, and finally 5 points of damage. Each round, the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage. Against flesh, the solvent is much less effective; it is caustic and burns painfully, inflicting 1 point of damage per caster level in the first round, but no further damage in the second or third round. However, the burning in the following rounds does inflict a –2 penalty to the victim’s attacks while the solvent is active. The solvent is extremely likely to cause extensive damage to the victim’s armor and equipment; item saving throws vs. acid may apply at the DM’s discretion. If the armor or equipment is magical in nature, then the saving throw is made with the usual bonuses allowed to the magical item. The great alchemist Vandarien developed his solvent to dissolve iron grates, stone and woodwork traps, and other such hazards. The solvent’s effectiveness against mineral or wood-based creatures was a mere side effect of his research. The material component of this spell is a mixture of vinegar, water, and a drop of black dragon acid."

The wall lasts as long as the wizard chooses to concentrate on maintaining it or one round per level if the wizard chooses not to concentrate on holding it together. The caster may shape the wall of water in one of three ways: A. Water Curtain. In this form, the wizard conjures one plane of water, 5 feet square and 1 foot thick, per experience level; for example, a 5th-level caster can create five 5-foot x 5-foot x 1-foot wall sections that would be enough to block an arched passageway 15 feet wide and 10 feet high with a curtain of water 1 foot thick. The curtain’s lower edge must rest upon the ground, but it need not be anchored on either side, and it remains cohesive and upright for the duration of the spell. Once raised, the wall cannot be moved. B. Hemisphere. In this manifestation, the wall of water forms a dome 1 foot thick over the caster, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level; a 7th-level caster could create a dome with a 10-foot radius. The wall must rest upon the ground. The dome is immobile. C. Sphere. If cast underwater, the caster may shape the wall of water into a sphere 1 foot thick, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level (no air is in the sphere). The sphere is centered on the caster and moves with him. In any form, the wall of water has two primary effects. First of all, missile fire through the wall is next to impossible, suffering a –4 attack penalty for each foot of thickness as well as a –1 damage penalty for every two feet of thickness. Creatures gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attack spells that must pass through the wall. If the spell allows no saving throw, none is granted by the wall of water. Secondly, physical passage through the wall is hindered; any creature trying to pass through must take one full round to do so and becomes soaked to the skin in the process. The wall of water can be defeated or bypassed by a number of spells or effects. At the end of the spell’s duration, the water loses its cohesiveness and collapses, which may surprise those sheltering under the hemisphere or standing next to the curtain. Note that the water itself may be fresh water (25% chance), salt water (50% chance), or brackish (25% chance), although the sphere will always be composed of the water type that surrounds it. The material component is a vial full of blessed spring water."

    "Description": "This spell is similar to a charm person spell, but it can affect any living creature--or several low-level creatures. The spell affects 2d4 Hit Dice or levels of creatures, although it only affects one creature of 4 or more Hit Dice or levels, regardless of the number rolled. All possible subjects receive saving throws vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. Any damage inflicted by the caster or his allies in the round of casting grants the wounded creature another saving throw at a bonus of +1 per point of damage received. Any affected creature regards the spellcaster as friendly, an ally or companion to be treated well or guarded from harm. If communication is possible, the charmed creature follows reasonable requests, instructions, or orders most faithfully (see the suggestion spell). If communication is not possible, the creature does not harm the caster, but others in the vicinity may be subject to its intentions, hostile or otherwise. Any overtly hostile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at the very least allows a new saving throw against the charm. Affected creatures eventually come out from under the influence of the spell. This is a function of the creature's level (i.e., its Hit Dice). Monster Level % Chance Per Week or Hit Dice of Breaking Spell 1st or up to 2 5% 2nd or up to 3+2 10% 3rd or up to 4+4 15% 4th or up to 6 25% 5th or up to 7+2 35% 6th or up to 8+4 45% 7th or up to 10 60% 8th or up to 12 75% 9th or over 12 90% The exact day of the week and time of day is secretly determined by the DM."

    "Description": "This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per caster level. These creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows: D10 Roll Action 1 Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell 2-6 Stand confused for one round (then roll again) 7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again) 10 Act normally for one round (then roll again) The spell lasts for two rounds plus one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the spell, or until the \"wander away for the duration of the spell\" result occurs. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to make the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused, and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two attacking the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stand confused, four attack, and one acts normally. The material component is a set of three nut shells."

Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling him to \"sweep\" areas for the duration of the spell. When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a saving throw. If this is failed, the identity and general location of the scryer immediately become known to the wizard who cast this spell. The general location is a direction and significant landmark close to the scryer. Thus, the caster might learn, \"The wizard Sniggel spies on us from east, under the stairs,\" or, \"You are watched by Asquil in the city of Samarquol.\" The material components for this spell are a small piece of mirror and a miniature brass hearing trumpet."

    "Description": "A dig spell enables the caster to excavate 125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per round (i.e., a cubic hole 5 feet on a side). In later rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start a new one. The material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit. If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every 5 feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud fills in and collapses after 5 feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug. Any creature at the edge (within 1 foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. Chances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported. The spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half. To activate the spell, the spellcaster needs a miniature shovel and tiny bucket and mustcontinue to hold them while each pit is excavated. These items disappear at the conclusion of the spell."

If distances are stated and the spellcaster arrives with no support below his feet (i.e., in mid-air), falling and damage result unless further magical means are employed. All that the wizard wears or carries, subject to a maximum weight equal to 500 pounds of nonliving matter, or half that amount of living matter, is transferred with the spellcaster.

The recipients fight without shield and regardless of life, never checking morale. This spell counters (and is countered by) fear. 2. Fear: The affected creatures flee in panic for 2d4 rounds. It counters (and is countered by) courage. 3. Friendship: The affected creatures react more positively (for example, tolerance becomes goodwill). It counters (and is countered by) hate. 4. Happiness: This effect creates joy and a feeling of complacent well-being, adding +4 to all reaction rolls and making attack unlikely unless the creatures are subject to extreme provocation. It counters (and is countered by) sadness. 5. Hate: The affected creatures react more negatively (for example, tolerance becomes negative neutrality). It counters (and is countered by) friendship. 6. Hope: The effect of hope is to raise morale, saving throw rolls, attack rolls, anddamage caused by +2. It counters (and is countered by) hopelessness. 7. Hopelessness: The affected creatures submit to the demands of any opponent: surrender, get out, etc. Otherwise, the creatures are 25% likely to do nothing in a round, and 25% likely to turn back or retreat. It counters (and is countered by) hope. 8. Sadness: This creates unhappiness and a tendency toward maudlin introspection. This emotion penalizes surprise rolls by -1 and adds +1 to initiative rolls. It counters (and is countered by) happiness. All creatures in the area at the instant the spell is cast are affected unless successful saving throws vs. spell are made, adjusted for Wisdom. The spell lasts as long as the wizard continues to concentrate on projecting the chosen emotion. Those who fail the saving throw against fear must roll a new saving throw if they return to the affected area."

Two small weapons (arrows, bolts, daggers, etc.) or one large weapon (axe, bow, hammer, mace, etc.) weapon can be affected by the spell.

Failure means the subject is treated exactly as if he had been drained of energy levels by a wight, one level for every four levels of the caster.

These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot-- including water. Each tentacle is 10 feet long, AC 4, and requires as many points of damage to destroy as the level of the wizard who cast the spell. There are 1d4 such tentacles, plus one per experience level of the spellcaster. Any creature within range of the writhing tentacles is subject to attack as determined by the DM. The target of a tentacle attack must roll a saving throw vs. spell. If this succeeds, the subject suffers 1d4 points of damage from contact with the tentacle; the tentacle is then destroyed. Failure to save indicates that the damage inflicted is 2d4 points, the ebon member is wrapped around its subject, and damage will be 3d4 points on the second and all succeeding rounds. Since these tentacles have no intelligence to guide them, there is the possibility that they entwine any object--a tree, post, pillar, even the wizard himself--or continue to squeeze a dead opponent. A grasping hold established by a tentacle remains until the tentacle is destroyed by some form of attack or until it disappears at the end of the spell's duration. The component for this spell is a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or giant squid."

Thus, at 10th level there is only a 15% chance, and at 13th level no chance, of dropping items.

Any creatures observing the fire or the dancing circle of flame around it must successfully roll a saving throw vs. spell or be charmed into remaining motionless and gazing, transfixed, at the flames. While so charmed, creatures are subject to suggestions of 12 or fewer words, saving vs. spell with a -3 penalty, adjusted for Wisdom. The caster can give one such suggestion to each creature, and the suggestions need not be the same. The maximum duration for such a suggestion is one hour, regardless of the caster's level. The fire charm is broken if the charmed creature is physically attacked, if a solid object comes between the creature and the veil of flames so as to obstruct vision, or when the duration of the spell expires. Those exposed to the fire charm again may be affected at the DM's option, although bonuses may also be allowed to the saving throws. Note that the veil of flame is not a magical fire, and passing through it incurs the same damage as would be sustained from passing through its original fire source. The material component for this spell is a small piece of multicolored silk of exceptional thinness that the spellcaster must throw into the fire source."

    "Description": "This spell can be cast in one of two forms: a warm shield that protects against cold-based attacks, or a chill shield that protects against fire-based attacks. Both return damage to creatures making physical attacks against the wizard. The wizard must choose which variation he memorizes when the spell is selected. When casting this spell, the wizard appears to immolate himself, but the flames are thin and wispy, shedding no heat, and giving light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch. The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)--blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each shield are as follows: A) Warm shield. The flames are warm to the touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved against with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no bonus against fire-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage. The material component for this variation is a bit of phosphorous. B) Chill shield. The flames are cool to the touch. Any fire-based attacks are saved against with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no bonus against cold-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage. The material component for this variation is a live firefly or glow worm or the tail portions of four dead ones. Any creature striking the spellcaster with its body or hand-held weapons inflicts normal damage upon the wizard, but the attacker suffers the same amount of damage. An attacker's magical resistance, if any, is tested when the creature actually strikes the wizard. Successful resistance shatters the spell. Failure means the creature's magic resistance does not affect that casting of the spell."

    "Description": "Any closeable item (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The spell is centered on a point selected by the spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed upon it (if such is attempted, the chance is 25% that the first spell fails, 25% that the second spell fails, or 50% that both spells fail). A knock spell does not affect a fire trap in any way--as soon as the offending party enters or touches the item, the trap discharges. Thieves and others have only half their normal chance to detect a fire trap (by noticing the characteristic markings required to cast the spell). They have only half their normal chance to remove the trap (failure detonates the trap immediately). An unsuccessful dispel does not detonate the spell. The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast (the exact method usually involves a keyword). When the trap is discharged, there is an explosion of 5-foot radius from the spell's center; all creatures within this area must rollsaving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the caster, or half this (round up) for creatures successfully saving. (Under water, this ward inflicts half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion. To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a bit of sulphur or saltpeter and touch the center of the effect. Attunement to another individual requires a hair or similar object from that person."

A pond can be made to look like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. The hallucinatory terrain persists until a dispel magic spell is cast upon the area or until the duration expires. Individual creatures may see through the illusion, but the illusion persists, affecting others who observe the scene. If the illusion involves only a subtle change, such as causing an open wood to appear thick and dark, or increasing the slope of a hill, the effect may be unnoticed even by those in the midst of it. If the change is extreme (for example, a grassy plain covering a seething field of volcanic mudpots), the illusion will no doubt be noticed the instant one person falls prey to it. Each level of experience expands the dimensions of the cubic area affected by 10 yards; for example, a 12th-level caster affects an area 120 yds. x 120 yds.x 120 yds.

Beings with high Hit Dice that might normally notice invisible opponents will notice a creature under this spell as if they had 2 fewer Hit Dice (they roll saving throws vs. spell; success indicates they spot the character)."

    "Description": "This spell enables the wizard to magically call into being a sturdy cottage or lodge, made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast--stone, timber, or (at worst) sod. The floor area of the lodging is 30 square feet per level of the spellcaster, and the surface is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two or more shuttered windows, and a small fireplace. While the lodging is secure against winds of up to 70 miles per hour, it has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise, as it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone, and is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege machinery or giants). The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being wizard locked and the latter being secured by a top grate of iron and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Lastly, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to the spellcaster. The inside of the shelter contains rude furnishings as desired by the spellcaster--up to eight bunks, a trestle table and benches, as many as four chairs or eight stools, and a writing desk. The material components of this spell are a square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the alarm and unseen servant spells if these benefits are to be included (string and silver wire and a small bell)."

Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful dispel magic spell. The caster can leave and return to the globe without penalty. Note that spell effects are not actually disrupted by the globe unless cast directly through or into it: The caster would still see a mirror image created by a wizard outside the globe. If that wizard then entered the globe, the images would wink out, to reappear when the wizard exited the globe.

Only the spell recipient can see the phantasmal killer (the caster sees only a shadowy shape), but if it succeeds in scoring a hit, the subject dies from fright. The beast attacks as a 4 Hit Dice monster. It is invulnerable to all attacks and can pass through any barriers, Once cast, it inexorably pursues the subject, for it exists only in the subject's mind. The only defenses against a phantasmal killer are an attempt to disbelieve (which can be tried but once), slaying or rendering unconscious the wizard who cast the spell, or rendering unconscious the target of the spell for its duration. To disbelieve the killer, the subject must specifically state the attempt and then roll an Intelligence check. This roll has a -1 penalty for every four levels of the caster. Special modifiers apply to this attack: Condition Modifier Surprise -2 Subject previously attacked by this spell +1 Subject is an illusionist +2 Subject is wearing a helm of telepathy +3 Magic resistance, bonuses against fear, and Wisdom adjustments also apply. Thesubject's magic resistance is checked first; if the spell overcomes the resistance, the subject's fear/Wisdom bonuses (if any) then apply as negative modifiers to his Intelligence check. If the subject of a phantasmal killer attack succeeds in disbelieving, and he is wearing a helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned upon the wizard, who must then disbelieve it or be subject to its attack and possible effects. If the subject ignores the killer to perform other actions, such as attacking the caster, the killer may, at the DM's option, gain bonuses to hit (for flank or rear attacks, etc.). Spells such as remove fear and cloak of bravery, cast after the killer has attacked, grant another check to disbelieve the effect."

The area must contain brush and trees for this spell to work. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become thick and overgrown so as to form a barrier. The area of effect is the caster's level, squared, times 100 square feet. This area can be arranged in any square or rectangular shape that the caster desires. Thus, an 8th-level wizard can affect (8 x 8 =) 64 x 100 square feet, or 6,400 square feet. This could be an 80-foot x 80-foot square, a 160-foot x 40-foot rectangle, a 640-foot x 10-foot rectangle, etc. Individual plant girth and height is generally affected less than thickness of brush, branch, and undergrowth.

    "Description": "The polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while a creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form into something with a higher Intelligence, it will not gain that creature's mental ability. The reverse-- polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence-- results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe.The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following). The polymorphed creature acquires the form and physical abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, and flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, and constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.). Hit points and saving throws do not change from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters (lycanthropes, dopplegangers, higher level druids, etc.) are affected for but one round, and can then resume their normal form. If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form, though it remains dead. (Note that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified. When the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (for example, -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it. When the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subject's personality and mentality change into that of the new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels] or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place. A subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities. For example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, it is 85% (20 - 8 Intelligence + 5 level difference [6-1] = 17 out of 20 = 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well. The wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintainshe is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad. The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon."

The spell does not give the new form's other abilities (attack, magic, special movement, etc.), nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.

A caster not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (for example, -2 penalty to attack rolls) until he practices sufficiently to master it. Thus, a wizard changed into an owl could fly, but his vision would be human; a change to a black pudding would enable movement under doors or along halls and ceilings, but not the pudding's offensive (acid) or defensive capabilities. Naturally, the strength of the new form is sufficient to enable normal movement. The spellcaster can change his form as often as desired for the duration of the spell, each change requiring a round. The wizard retains his own hit points, attack rolls, and saving throws. The wizard can end the spell at any time; when voluntarily returning to his own form and ending the spell, he regains 1d12 hit points. The wizard also will return to his own form when slain or when the effect is dispelled, but no hit points are restored in these cases."

Anattack on an affected creature that causes damage frees it from the spell immediately. Creatures that are restrained and removed from the area still try to follow the pattern. Once the rainbow pattern is cast, the wizard need only gesture in the direction he desires, and the pattern of colors moves slowly off in that direction, at the rate of 30 feet per round.

The total Hit Dice of the shadow monster or monsters thus created cannot exceed the level of experience of the wizard; thus, a 10th-level wizard can create one creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that have 5 Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters created by one spell must be of the same sort. The actual hit point total for each monster is 20% of the hit point total it would normally have. (To determine this, roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply the hit points by .2. Any remainder less than .4 is dropped--in the case of monsters with 1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the monster was not successfully created--and scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 hit point.) Those viewing the shadow monsters are allowed to disbelieve as per normal illusions, although there is a -2 penalty to the attempt. The shadow monsters perform as the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Those who believe in the shadow monster suffer real damage from their attacks. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do not actually occur, but a subject who believes they are real will react appropriately. Those who roll successful saving throws see the shadow monsters as transparent images superimposed on vague shadowy forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractionaldamage less than .4 as done with hit points. For example: A shadow monster griffon attacks a person who knows it is only quasi- real. The monster strikes with two claw attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die monster. All three attacks hit; the normal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by .2 separately, rounded up or down, and added together to get the total damage. Thus, if the attacks score 4, 2 and 11 points, a total of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x .2 = .8 [rounded to 1], 2 x .2 = .4 [rounded to 1], 11 x .2 = 2.2 [rounded to 2].

    "Description": "When this spell is cast, the affected creature gains a virtual immunity to any attack by cut, blow, projectile, or the like. Even a sword of sharpness cannot affect a creature protected by stoneskin, nor can a rock hurled by a giant, a snake's strike, etc. However, magical attacks from such spells as fireball, magic missile, lightning bolt, and so forth have their normal effects. The spell's effects are not cumulative with multiple castings. The spell blocks 1d4 attacks, plus one attack per two levels of experience the caster has achieved. This limit applies regardless of attack rolls and regardless of whether the attack was physical or magical. For example, a stoneskin spell cast by a 9th-level wizard would protect against from five to eight attacks. An attacking griffon would reduce the protection by three each round; four magic missiles would count as four attacks in addition to inflicting their normal damage. The material components of the spell are granite and diamond dust sprinkled on the recipient's skin."

    "Description": "When a vacancy spell is cast, the wizard causes an area to appear to be vacant, neglected, and unused. Those who behold the area see dust on the floor, cobwebs, dirt, and other conditions typical of a long-abandoned place. If they pass through the area of effect, they seem to leave tracks, tear away cobwebs, and so on. Unless they actually contact some object cloaked by the spell, the place appears empty. Merely brushing an invisible object does not cause the vacancy spell to be disturbed: Only forceful contact grants a chance to note that all is not as it seems. If forceful contact with a cloaked object occurs, those creatures subject to the spell can penetrate the spell only if they discover several items that they cannot see; each being is then entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. Failure means they believe that the objects are invisible. A dispel magic spell cancels this spell so that the true area is seen. A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, and similar effects can penetrate the deception, but a detect invisibility spell cannot. This spell is a very powerful combination of invisibility and illusion, but it can cloak only nonliving things. Living things are not made invisible, but their presence does nototherwise disturb the spell. The wizard must have a square of the finest black silk to cast this spell. This material component must be worth at least 100 gp and is used up during spellcasting."

The spell creates either an opaque sheet of flame up to one 20-foot square per level of the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet per two levels of experience of the wizard. In either form, the wall of fire is 20 feet high. The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the caster. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of damage upon those within 20 feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, upon any creature passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to catch a moving creature with a newly-created wall of fire is difficult; a successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and direction of movement determine which side of the created wall it is on. The wall of fire lasts as long as the wizard concentrates on maintaining it, or one round per level of experience of the wizard, in the event he does not wish to concentrate upon it.

    "Description": "This spell can be cast in one of three ways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a hemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall upon creatures with the effect of an ice storm. A) Ice plane. When this spell is cast, a sheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall is primarily defensive, stopping pursuers and the like. The wall is 1 inch thick per level of experience of the wizard. It covers a 10-foot-square area per level (a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, etc.). Any creature breaking through the ice suffers 2 points of damage per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, while cold- using creatures suffer only 1 point of damage per inch when breaking through. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored along one or more sides.B) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell creates a hemisphere whose maximum radius is equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents under the hemisphere. C) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents. The sheet covers a 10-foot-square area per caster level. The sheet has the same effect as an ice storm's hail stones--3d10 points of damage inflicted to creatures beneath it. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures; its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Magical fires such as fireballs and fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one round, though this creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires or lesser magical ones do not hasten the melting of a wall of ice. The material component of this spell is a small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal."

The wizard eye travels at 30 feet per round if viewing an area ahead as a human would (i.e., primarily looking at the floor), or 10 feet per round if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The wizard eye can see with infravision up to 10 feet, and with normal vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit areas. The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a detect invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye, although it can pass through a space no smaller than a small mouse hole (1 inch in diameter). Using the eye requires the wizard to concentrate. However, if his concentration is broken, the spell does not end--the eye merely becomes inert until the wizard again concentrates, subject to the duration of the spell. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other pells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful dispel cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell. With respect to blindness, magical darkness, and so on, the wizard eye is considered an independent sensory organ of the caster. The material component of the spell is a bit of bat fur."

This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, and so forth. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area in which the protected wizard were standing. One to four (1d4) spell levels may be turned. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows how effective the spell is. Unlike the 7th level version of this spell, minor spell turning is not capable of partially turning a spell. For example, if a wizard has three levels of spell turning, he can turn three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level spell. He can in no way turn spells of 4th level or above. If the caster is the target of a spell of a higher level than he is capable of turning, the caster receives the full brunt of the spell. If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects: D100 Roll Effect 01-70 Spell drains away without effect 71-80 Spell affects both equally at full damage 81-47 Both turning effects are rendered non-functional for 1d4 turns 48-00 Both casters are sucked through a rift into the Positive Material plane The material component of this spell is a smoothly polished silver coin."

Feather fall is an exception; the rate of descent may be reduced by 25% at the caster's option. The area of effect is always the caster, except in the case of the haste spell, for which the effects of the celerity will operate on 1d4 creatures in addition to the wizard.

For the spell to be effective, the caster and the lycanthrope must be on the same plane of existence; there is no other range limitation. When the spell is cast, the nearest lycanthrope (as determined by the DM) of the chosen species must attempt a saving throw. If successful, the creature is unaffected. If it fails, the lycanthrope instantly appears near the caster. Upon arrival, the creature can freely attack the wizard unless the caster has created a warding circle. If a circle is present, the lycanthrope appears in the circle; otherwise, it appears 1d10 feet away from the caster in a random direction (the DM should use the scatter diagram for grenade-like missiles found in the DUNGEON MASTER® Guide to determine direction). A warding circle is a temporary prison drawn with specially prepared pigments laced with silver filings. These pigments cost 100 gp for each foot of diameter of the circle (thus, a circle 10 feet across costs 1,000 gp). A warding circle must be at least 5 feet in diameter; if smaller, the lycanthrope is automatically freed. Preparing the circle takes one turn per foot of diameter. Even with such protection, the lycanthrope can break out of the circle and wreak vengeance upon the summoner. The creature's base chance of success is 20%, modified by the difference between its Hit Dice and the wizard's experience level. If the spellcaster is of a higher level, the difference is subtracted from the creature's chance of escaping the circle. If the lycanthrope is of higher Hit Dice than the wizard's level, the difference is added to its chance. Each creature is allowed only one attempt to escape. Any break in the circle spoils the power of the spell and enables the lycanthrope to break free. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature cannot take any action against any portion of the ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents this. Once safely ensnared, the lycanthrope can be held for as long as the summoner dares. The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the magical barrier. When the full moon sets, the lycanthrope reverts to its human form. At this time, it is free of the spell and may leave the circle. The material components are a drop of blood from any animal, a human hair, and a moonstone worth at least 150 gp. If the caster elects to create the warding circle, the"

    "Description": "This peculiar wild magic creates a random fluctuation in the probabilities of existence. The spell can be cast only upon nonliving objects and can affect only materials within a 10'x10'x10' cube. Objects in the area of effect either remain normal and visible or they disappear (50% chance). The state of existence for any object is determined randomly and changes with each viewing and viewer. Thus, a single object could appear and disappear several times during the course of the spell. Furthermore, it might be \"there\" for one onlooker, but \"not there\" for another. For example, a wild mage casts this spell on a doorway. The DM rolls percentile dice and determines the door is \"there\" for the wizard. The wizard's companion also looks at the door. The DM rolls and determines that the door is \"not there\" for the companion. The pair studies the door for several minutes, during which time the door does not change (this counts as a single viewing for each character). The wizard and his companion then close their eyes. When they look at the door again, new checks for each character reveal the door is \"not there\" for both characters. The pair steps through the open archway and turns around to look at the door once again. This time it is \"not there\" for the wizard, but \"there\" for his companion. This random changing continues throughout the duration of the spell. Objects that are \"there\" are normal in all respects. Doors can be opened, chests can be picked up and carried, and rocks can be used as barricades. Objects that are \"not there\" are gone, although their absence does not cause ceilings to collapse or other damage. A wizard could walk through a \"not there\" wall without difficulty. When two parties perceive a there/not there object differently, the object functions for each party according to its own perceptions. For example, a wizard hides behind a rock that he sees as \"there.\" Her enemy, a fighter, perceives the rock as \"not there\" and fires arrows at the wizard. The wizard would perceive the arrows as bouncing off the rock, while the fighter would perceive the arrows as missing their target or falling short. The fighter would be subject to a check before firing each arrow to determine whether his perception changes (assume that the fighter must look away from the rock every time he nocks an arrow; each time he takes aim, this counts as a new viewing). After the spell is cast, any objects removed from the area of effect retain their uncertain existence for the duration of the spell. Thus, a pair of heroes could pick up a treasure chest, carry it down the hall, set it down, and discover it had vanished while their backs were turned. Worse still, one might see the chest and the other not! The material component is a small piece of cat fur sealed inside a small box."

The maximum range of attack is equal to 50 feet plus 10 feet per level of the caster. Only the caster may throw the pebble. The wizard can enchant one stone at 7th level and gains one stone per three levels of experience thereafter (two stones at 10th level, three at 13th level, etc.). Only one pebble may be thrown per round, and pebbles must be hurled in consecutive rounds. The spell has a duration in rounds equal to the number of pebbles enchanted. Each pebble requires a separate attack roll. Pebbles may be thrown at different targets within range. The material components are pebbles, which revert to normal size when the spell expires. The reverse of this spell, turn boulder to pebble, shrinks a boulder to the size of a pebble. It affects only naturally occurring rocks and can not be used to shrink a statue or a cut gemstone. The number of rocks that may be affected is equal to the number of experience levels of the caster. Boulders must not exceed one cubic foot per level of the caster. Thus, a 10th-level wizard could shrink 10 rocks, each of which is equal to or less than 10 cubic feet in size. All rocks are affected in the same round the spell is cast.

The fire aura extends 1 foot from the caster's body and provides illumination in a 10-foot radius. The fire aura provides complete immunity to all forms of fire, both natural and magical; the flames can be extinguished only by dispel magic or a similar spell. Those touching the fire aura suffer 2-8 (2d4) hit points of damage; additionally, if the touched victim fails to make his saving throw, his body is set afire with green flames. The flames persist for 2-8 (2d4) rounds and can be extinguished only by dispel magic or a similar spell. Each round the victim is engulfed in these flames, he suffers an additional 1-6 hit points of damage; the victim's attack rolls are made with a -2 penalty during this time. The material components for this spell are a scrap of singed paper and a piece of flint"

Those outside the area of effect do not notice the tremendous winds, though objects may be blown out of the spell's area into their path. The DM should determine the precise effects of the wind breath using the following parameters as guidelines. If the wind breath is 30-50 miles per hour, there is a 10 percent chance that small boats capsize, a 1 percent chance that ships capsize, and a 10 percent chance that a man is knocked down. There is a 20 percent chance that branches snap, light articles are blown away, and tents and sails tear.

If the wind breath is 50-70 miles per hour, there is a 70 percent chance that small boats capsize, a 20 percent chance that ships capsize, and a 50 percent chance that a man is knocked down. Trees bend and there is a 70 percent chance that branches snap, and a 20 percent chance that a trunk snaps. Medium-sized articles are blown away, and there is a 50 percent chance that tents and sails are torn, and a 40 percent chance that shacks are blown down. Creatures caught in the cone of the wind breath suffer 1-4 hit points of damage from sand and grit. Flying creatures are blown back 10-40 (10d4) feet.) If the wind breath is 70 miles per hour or more, there is a 100 percent chance that small boats capsize, a 70 percent chance that ships capsize, and a 70 percent chance that a man is knocked down and blown 10-40 (10d4) feet to suffer 1-6 hit points of damage per 10 feet blown. There is a 70 percent chance that tree trunks snap, and a 100 percent chance that branches are ripped from trees. Heavy articles are blown away, medium articles are ripped from fastenings, and tents and sails have a 70 percent chance of being destroyed. There is a 20 percent chance that common buildings are blown down and a 60 percent chance that shacks are flattened. Creatures caught in the cone of the wind breath suffer 1-8 hit points of damage from blown objects. Flying creatures are blown back 50- 100 (40+10d6) feet.

    "Description": "A wizard using this spell, which operates much like a forget spell, can permanently burn from the memory of any one creature all knowledge of either a specific place or person or a time period of up to one year (the spellcaster may choose the desired result). The spell works on any intelligent creature by destroying a portion of its brain, but a victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. death magic to resist the effects of the spell. If successful, the creature suffers only a painful headache, which dissipates in 1-4 hours but is otherwise harmless. If failed, the victim suffers 1-6 points of damage from an excruciating headache, leaving him or her with selected gaps in his memory. Brainkill can affect only the victim's memory and ability to recall factual information. For example, a person thus affected might be completely unable to remember details of a place, the name, appearance, or any traits of a person, or might have a one-year blank in his or her memory. The spell has no effect on a persons learned abilities or skills. For instance, suppose an individual gained a swimming proficiency six months before coming under the influence of this spell. While the victim will no longer recall the swimming lessons, he or she still retains the ability, though it might not become evident until the victim jumps into a large body of water. Aside from relearning it as best as one can, the lost knowledge and memories can never be regained except by a wish."

    "CastingTime": "1 round",
    "Duration": "Permanent",
    "Description": "By casting this spell, a wizard transfers some of the wounds of another creature to him- or herself, thereby partially curing the recipient. Up to 2 hp per level of the caster may be transferred, so a 10th level necromancer could cure an ally of a 20-hp wound (but the wizard will then take 20 hp in damage). The hit point loss could have originally resulted from physical attacks, certain poisons, spell effects, diseases, or curses (except those that cannot be removed by the remove curse spell). This spell cannot restore amputated limbs, drained life levels, or lost life. It also cannot undo any continuously acting poison or disease. The spell only temporarily reverses such harm, which will then continue to affect the victim. The caster cannot drain his or her own life. Normally, a wizard can only transfer up to his or her current number of hit points. However, if the DM makes use of the rules for \"hovering on death's door\" (page 75 of the DMG), then a necromancer might be voluntarily drained to the brink of death (-9 hp). Of course, the mage immediately loses consciousness in such a case (as noted in the DMG), but his or her condition does not deteriorate unless further wounded by another agent. At the DM's discretion, this spell also enables a necromancer to immediately restore an incapacitated and dying victim, as per the 3rd- level priest spell death's door. Unlike the priest version, however, hit points cured by the wound transfer are inflicted on the caster. Hit points lost by the wizard may be regained by normal healing or magic. Finally, after the transfer is complete, the wizard temporarily loses four points of Constitution due to extreme exhaustion; each point may be recovered by six turns of complete rest. If the caster's Constitution drops below 3, unconsciousness results, and full Constitution is not regained for 24 hours. The material components are hair and blood from both the recipient and the caster, two newt eyes, and two wolf teeth (each from a different animal). These components are consumed in the casting."

The wizard must decide which elemental-kin he will conjure when he memorizes the spell since the components and procedures are different for each. An elemental specialist can conjure only from his own element. Elemental-kin can only be conjured if there is a good amount of their native element at hand; a good-sized fire or a body of water is required for those elemental-kin. In addition to this and either an aquamarine, amber, ruby or emerald gem worth 1,500 gold pieces, the wizard must also provide the spell’s material component, which varies by element: Air Elemental-kin: Burning incense Earth Elemental-kin: Soft clay Fire Elemental-kin: Sulphur and phosphorus Water Elemental-kin: Water and sand The elemental-kin is bound to obey the wizard’s commands and will not turn against him, but it is generally annoyed by its summoning and cooperates only as instructed. Given the chance, the creature will disappear and return to its home in the elemental planes; in order to prevent this, the wizard must concentrate on keeping the creature from leaving. (If the wizard is wounded or grappled, or casts another spell, his concentration is broken.) The elemental-kin can be controlled or maintained at a distance of 30 yards per caster level. The various elemental-kin creatures are described in detail in the Monstrous Manual tome, under the heading Elemental. At the DM’s option, other elemental creatures of 4 Hit Dice or less may be summoned with this spell."

    "Description": "By casting this spell, the wizard can empower a creature with superhuman strength. Unlike the 2nd-level strength spell, improved strength allows the recipient of the spell to ignore race or class restrictions on his maximum Strength score, possibly reaching scores as high as 25. The exact amount of strength gained varies by the recipient’s class group: Class Strength Gain* Warrior 1d8+4 (max 25) Priest 1d6+4 (max 23) Rogue 1d6+4 (max 23) Wizard 1d4+4 (max 21) * Count each percentile bracket of exceptional strength as one point; the strength gain proceeds as 18, 18/01, 18/51, 18/76, 18/91, 18/00, 19, and so on. Even if the recipient is not a warrior, he gains all the benefits of an exceptional Strength category; for example, if a thief with a Strength of 14 gained 7 points, he would possess a Strength of 18/76 for the duration of the spell. In addition to the attack and damage bonus, increased chance to open doors or bend bars, and increased carrying capacity, the spell recipient may temporarily gain the ability to throw boulders as a giant of equivalent Strength, as shown below: Strength Equivalent Rock Hurling Score Giant Type Range Damage 19 Hill giant 80 yards 1d6 20 Stone giant 100 yards 1d8 21 Frost giant 100 yards 1d8 22 Fire giant 120 yards 1d8 23 Cloud giant 140 yards 1d10 24 Storm giant 160 yards 1d12 25 Titan 200 yards 1d20 When the spell ends, the recipient is struck by intense exhaustion; he can do nothing except rest for 1d3 full turns to recover his strength.

The caster specifies the conditions of the lesser geas when he casts the spell; the victim must be intelligent, conscious, able to understand the caster, and not under the influence of any spells or effects that affect or control its mind. The lesser geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that will result in certain death, although the wizard can use the spell to coerce the subject into almost any other nondestructive course of action. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the lesser geas, but suffers a –2 penalty on its save if the wizard is of higher level or Hit Dice, or a –4 penalty if the wizard is more than twice the victim’s level or Hit Dice. The wizard must be careful in the wording of his lesser geas since the casting and fulfillment are tricky. The subject should be given a tangible, achievable goal, with clear courses of action available to him. “Climb that mountain!” or “Tear that mountain down rock by rock!” are legitimate geases, but a geas such as “Become a mountain!” is just not specific enough to work. Similar to the 6th-level spell geas, the lesser geas compels the subject to obey the wizard’s command. If the geased creature fails to follow the wizard’s instructions, it will grow sick—each week that passes, the creature loses one point from each ability score, 1 hit point per Hit Die, and suffers a cumulative –1 penalty to attack rolls and saving throws. These penalties cannot reduce an ability score to less than 3, reduce a creature to less than 1 hit point per Hit Die, or reduce its attacks and saves by more than 4 points. The lesser geas can be countermanded by a remove curse spell, or a limited wish or wish. However, if the subject entertains thoughts of removing the lesser geas, it will protect itself by giving the subject a warning headache. If the subject persists, then the sickness will begin,"

Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 3-foot radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster—for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of damage. The victim may attempt a saving throw vs. spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no saving throw. Just like magic missile, the force spheres may be directed at as many or as few targets as the caster likes. The missiles can easily damage or destroy inanimate objects, especially fragile or delicate items."

Any attempt to subvert or destroy the wizard’s mind automatically fails, but the wizard is still vulnerable to spells or effects that influence his actions without taking control of his psyche.

The acid can also be neutralized with soda, ash, lye, charcoal, or removed with a large quantity of water. The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-foot radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. paralyzation or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five caster levels. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.

Of course, the questioners must speak the same language as the dead creature. Summoning a dead spirit is far from a certain or trouble-free enterprise. The base chance that a spirit will answer the summons is 50% + 1% for each experience level of the wizard casting the spell. This chanceof success also depends on the authority of the caster in the spirit world, the length of time the subject has been dead, and the specific time of day during the casting (see Table 11).

If the spell fails, there is always the chance that the summoning will attract the attention of some other (potentially hostile) spirit or undead creature, either from the netherworld or the general vicinity of the caster. The chances of summoning a malicious undead are 5%, cumulative with every failed attempt by the same caster. The DM may roll on the table for the clerical spell summon undead. Note that this spell in no way protects the wizard (or those present at the casting) from the attacks of inadvertently summoned undead. If the summoning is successful, the desired spirit slowly rises from the ground before the caster. The spirit's willingness to answer questions will first determine the effectiveness of the spell. If the spirit is of a different alignment than the caster or formerly had more hit dice than the caster's current level of experience, the shade is entitled to a saving throw vs. spells to resist the interrogation. Provided that the spirit is agreeable, it can answer no more than one question for every three levels of the caster. Summoned spirits tend to be evasive and cryptic when questioned by the living. In general, their knowledge is limited to what they knew while alive. A spirit may also be called upon to answer specific questions about the near future, regarding actions undertaken before the next nightfall. Questions andpredictions about future events are subject to the same conditions and limitations as the priest spell augury. This spell requires a shallow pit filled with the blood from a slaughtered ram. The pit opens a symbolic link with the netherworld, while the blood serves to lure a spirit back into the world of the living. Note that the blood may also attract hostile undead (if the summoning fails). The DM may care to modify this spell so that it always summons a host of spirits (numbering 1-20) who must be individually questioned and placated before the desired shade arrives. The DM may also care to increase the chances of summoning a hostile undead (even if the spell succeeds) to reflect the caster's location and the tone of the campaign. Obviously, calling a beneficial spirit near the burial mound of a wraith may bring both creatures to investigate the unusual summons."

The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The following types of dead creatures can be animated: A) Humans, demihumans, and humanoids with 1 Hit Die. The wizard can animate one skeleton for each experience level he has attained, or one zombie for every two levels. The experience levels, if any, of the slain are ignored; the body of a newly dead 9th-level fighter is animated as a zombie with 2 Hit Dice, without special class or racial abilities. B) Creatures with more than 1 Hit Die. The number of undead animated is determined by the monster Hit Dice (the total Hit Dice cannot exceed the wizard's level). Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have one more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level wizard could animate four zombie gnolls (4 x [2+1 Hit Dice] = 12), or a single fire giant skeleton. Such undead have none of the special abilities they had in life. C) Creatures with less than 1 Hit Die. The caster can animate two skeletons per level or one zombie per level. The creatures have their normal Hit Dice as skeletons and an additional Hit Die as zombies. Clerics receive a +1 bonus when trying to turn these. This spell assumes that the bodies or bones are available and are reasonably intact (those of skeletons or zombies destroyed in combat won't be!). It requires a drop of blood and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. The casting of this spell is not a good act, and only evil wizards use it frequently."

    "Description": "By means of this spell, the caster sets up a natural repulsion between the affectedobject and all other living things except himself. Thus, any living creature attempting to touch the affected object is repulsed (unable to come closer than 1 foot), or repulses the affected object, depending on the relative mass of the two (a halfling attempting to touch an iron chest with an avoidance spell upon it will be thrown back, while the chest will skitter away from a giant-sized creature as the creature approaches). The material component for the spell is a magnetized needle. The spell cannot be cast upon living things; any attempt to cast avoidance upon the apparel or possessions of a living creature entitles the subject creature to a saving throw vs. spell. The reverse of this spell, attraction, uses the same material components and sets up a natural attraction between the affected object and all living things. A creature is drawn to the object if the creature is smaller, or the object slides toward the creature if the creature is larger. It takes a successful bend bars/lift gates roll to remove the enchanted object once it has adhered to an object or creature."

This disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to get around it. Neither invisibility nor polymorph fools the hand once a creature has been chosen. The hand does not pursue an opponent. The size of the hand is determined by the wizard, and it can be from human size (5 feet) all the way up to titan size (25 feet). It provides cover for the caster against the selected opponent, with all the attendant combat adjustments. It has as many hit points as the caster in full health and has an Armor Class of 0. Any creature weighing less than 2,000 pounds trying to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal movement. If the original opponent is slain, the caster can designate a new opponent for the hand. The caster can command the hand out of existence at any time. The material component of the spell is a soft glove."

The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per caster level. Those allowed saving throws roll them vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those who successfully save are unaffected by the spell. Affected creatures react as follows: D10 Roll Action 1 Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell 2-6 Stand confused for one round (then roll again) 7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again) 10 Act normally for one round (then roll again) The spell lasts one round for each level of the caster. Those affected are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the spell, or until the \"wander away for the duration of the spell\" result occurs. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible using their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. The material component for this spell is a small disc of bronze and a small rod of iron."

Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect. The cloudkill moves away from the spellcaster at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. A moderate breeze causes it to alter course (roll for direction), but it does not move back toward its caster. A strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force prevents the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds. As the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants, for example. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast under water."

    "Description": "There are actually four spells in the conjure elemental spell. The wizard is able to conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemental with this spell--assuming he has the material component for the particular elemental. (A considerable fire source must be in range to conjure a fire elemental; a large amount of water must be available to conjure a water elemental.) Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice. It is possible to conjure successive elementals of different types if the spellcaster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. Each type of elemental can be conjured only once per day. The conjured elemental must be controlled by the wizard--the spellcaster must concentrate on the elemental doing his commands--or it turns on the wizard and attacks. The elemental will not break off a combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of concentration. This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round. An elemental that breaks free of its control can be dispelled by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The elemental can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or until the spell's duration expires. Note that water elementals are destroyed if they are ever more than 60 yards from a large body of water. The material component of the spell (besides the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of one of the following: Air Elemental--burning incense Earth Elemental--soft clay Fire Elemental--sulphur and phosphorus Water Elemental--water and sandSpecial protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a protection from evil spell."

    "Description": "When this spell is cast, the wizard sends his mind to another plane of existence in order to receive advice and information from powers there. As these powers resent such contact, only brief answers are given. (The DM answers all questions with \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"maybe,\" \"never,\" \"irrelevant,\" etc.) Any questions asked are answered by the power during the spell's duration. The character can contact an elemental plane or some plane farther removed. For every two levels of experience of the wizard, one question may be asked. Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the wizard increases the probability of the spellcaster going insane or dying, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the Intelligence of the power contacted determines the effects. The accompanying random table is subject to DM changes, development of extraplanar NPC beings, and so on. If insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the first question is asked. This condition lasts for one week for each removal of the plane contacted (see the DMG or the Planescape ™ Campaign Setting boxed set), to a maximum of 10 weeks. There is a 1% chance per plane that the wizard dies before recovering, unless a remove curse spell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard can recall the answer to the question. On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by the action of certain lesser or greater powers. Chance of Chance of Chance of Plane Insanity * Knowledge Veracity ** Elemental Plane 20% 55% (90%) 62% (75%) Inner Plane 25% 60% 65% Astral Plane 30% 65% 67% Outer Plane, Int 19 35% 70% 70% Outer Plane, Int 20 40% 75% 73% Outer Plane, Int 21 45% 80% 75% Outer Plane, Int 22 50% 85% 78% Outer Plane, Int 23 55% 90% 81% Outer Plane, Int 24 60% 95% 85% Outer Plane, Int 25 65% 98% 90% * For every point of Intelligence over 15, the wizard reduces the chance of insanity by 5%.** If the being does not know an answer, and the chance of veracity is not made, the being will emphatically give an incorrect answer. If the chance of veracity is made, the being will answer \"unknown.\" Percentages in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate elemental plane. Optional Rule The DM may allow a specific Outer Plane to be contacted (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). In this case, the difference in alignment between the caster and the plane contacted alters the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted--each difference in moral or ethical alignment lowers the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted by 1. For example, an 18th-level lawful good caster could contact Mount Celestia (a lawful good plane) on the \"Intelligence 20\" line, or Elysium (a neutral good plane) on the \"Intelligence 19\" line."

If the wizard's level is higher, the difference is subtracted from the creature's die roll for its saving throw vs. spell.

The wizard must also cast a conjure elemental spell to summon an earth elemental. The elemental serves without attempting to break free when the spellcaster announces that his intent is to cast a distance distortion spell. The spell places the earth elemental in the area of effect, and the elemental then causes the area's dimensions to be either doubled or halved for those traveling over it (spellcaster's choice). Thus, a 10-foot x 100-foot corridor could seem to be either 5 feet wide and 50 feet long or 20 feet wide and 200 feet long. When the spell duration has elapsed, the elemental returns to its own plane. The true nature of an area affected by distance distortion is undetectable to any creature traveling along it, but the area dimly radiates magic, and a true seeing spell can reveal that an earth elemental is spread within the area.

Elves and half- elves resist this enchantment as they do all charm-type spells. When the spell is cast, the subject must roll a saving throw vs. spell at a penalty of -2, but Wisdom adjustments apply. Failure means the wizard has established a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If a common language is shared, the wizard can generally force the subject to perform as the wizard desires, within the limits of the subject's body structure and Strength. Note that the caster does not receive direct sensory input from the subject. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, there is no limit to the range at which it can be exercised, as long as the caster and subject are on the same plane. A protection from evil spell can prevent the caster from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it cannot prevent the establishment of domination."

At the beginning of the spell, the caster must name the recipient or identify him by some title that leaves no doubt as to his identity. As the caster completes the spell, the person sending the spell falls into a deep trancelike sleep, and instantaneously projects his mind to the recipient. The sender then enters the recipient's dream and delivers the message unless the recipient is magically protected. If the recipient is awake, the message sender can choose to remain in the trancelike sleep. If the sender is disturbed during this time, the spell is immediately cancelled and the sender comes out of the trance. The whereabouts and current activities of the recipient cannot be learned through this spell. The sender is unaware of his own surroundings or the activities around him while he is in his trance. He is totally defenseless, both physically and mentally (i.e., he always fails any saving throw) while in the trance. Once the recipient's dreams are entered, the sender can deliver a message of any length, which the recipient remembers perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way; the recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the sender gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the sender's mind returns instantly to his body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the sender to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message. The reverse of this spell, nightmare, enables the caster to send a hideous and unsettling vision to the recipient, who is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and unable to regain spells for the next day. A dispel evil spell cast upon the recipient stuns the caster of the nightmare for one turn per level of the cleric countering this evil sending."

If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, the wizard must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One wizard can have but one pair of these chests at any given time--even wish spells do not allow exceptions! The chests themselves arenonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest. While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This causes the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal Plane. The chest can contain 1 cubic foot of material per level of the wizard no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magical items, gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the small duplicate of the magical chest, he can recall the large one from the Ethereal Plane whenever the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can return, although an expedition might be mounted to find it. While the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, there is a cumulative 1% chance per week that some being finds it. This chance is reset to 1% whenever the chest is recalled and the spell recast to return it to the Ethereal Plane. If the chest is found, the DM must work out the encounter and decide how the being reacts to the chest (for example, it might ignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, or even exchange or add to the items present!). Whenever the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened for a variable amount of time (usually about one turn); the window slowly diminishes in size. When this hole opens between the planes, check for an ethereal encounter to see if a monster is drawn through. If the large chest is not retrieved before the spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is lost."

    "Name": "Magic Jar",

    "AoE": "1 creature",
    "CastingTime": "1 rd.",

    "Description": "The magic jar spell enables the caster to shift his life force into a special receptacle (a gem or large crystal). From there the caster can force an exchange of life forces between the receptacle and another creature, thus enabling the wizard to take over and control the body of another creature, while the life force of the host is confined in the receptacle. The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the wizard's body at the time of spellcasting. The wizard's life force shifts into the receptacle in the round in which the casting is completed, allowing no other actions. While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life force within a 10-foot- per-level radius (on the same plane); however, the exact creature types and relative physical positions cannot be determined. In a group of life forces, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy. For example, if two 10th-level fighters are attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the caster could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all with positive life energy. The caster could try to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but he has no control over exactly which creature is attacked. An attempt to take over a host body requires a full round. It is blocked by a protectionfrom evil spell or similar ward. It is successful only if the subject fails a saving throw vs. spell with a special modifier (see following). The saving throw is modified by subtracting the combined Intelligence and Wisdom scores of the target from those of the wizard (Intelligence and Hit Dice in nonhuman or nonhumanoid creatures). This modifier is added to (or subtracted from) the die roll. Difference Die Adjustment -9 or less +4 -8 to -6 +3 -5 to -3 +2 -2 to 0 +1 +1 to +4 0 +5 to +8 -1 +9 to +12 -2 +13 or more -3 A negative score indicates that the wizard has a lower total than the target; thus, the host has a saving throw bonus. Failure to take over the host leaves the wizard's life force in the magic jar. If successful, the caster's life force occupies the host body and the host's life force is confined in the magic jar receptacle. The caster can call upon rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its real or acquired knowledge (i.e., the wizard does not automatically know the language or spells of the creature). The caster retains his own attack rolls, class knowledge and training, and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If the host body is human or humanoid, and the necessary spell components are available, the wizard can even use his memorized spells. The host body retains its own hit points and physical abilities and properties. The DM decides if any additional modifications are necessary; for example, perhaps clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the caster must become used to the new form. The alignment of the host or receptacle is that of the occupying life force. The caster can shift freely from the host to the receptacle if within the 10-foot-per-level range. Each attempt to shift requires one round. The spell ends when the wizard shifts from the jar to his own body. A successful dispel magic spell cast on the host can drive the caster of the magic jar spell back into the receptacle and prevent him from making any attacks for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of the dispel. The base success chance is 50%, plus or minus 5% per level difference between the casters. A successful dispel magic cast against the receptacle forces the occupant back into his own body. If the wizard who cast the magic jar is forced back into his own body, the spell ends. If the host body is slain, the caster returns to the receptacle, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the host and the caster die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, resurrection, or similar spell. If the body of the caster is slain, his life force survives if it is in either the receptacle or the host. If the receptacle is destroyed while the caster's life force occupies it, the caster isirrevocably slain."

The duration of the created item varies with its relative hardness and rarity: Vegetable matter 2 hours/level Stone or crystal 1 hour/level Precious metals 2 turns/level Gems 1 turn/level Mithral* 2 rounds/level Adamantite 1 round/level * Includes similar rare metals. Attempting to use any of these as material components in a spell will cause the spell to fail. The spellcaster must have at least a tiny piece of matter of the same type as the item he plans to create--a bit of twisted hemp to create rope, a chip of stone to create a boulder, and so on."

He may then command it to perform as guardian of a passage, room, door, or similar space or portal. The phantom watchdog immediately commences a loud barking if any creature larger than a cat approaches the place it guards. As the faithful hound is able to detect invisible creatures and ward against the approach of ethereal creatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does not react to illusions that are not at least quasi-real. If the intruding creature exposes its back to the watchdog, the dog delivers a vicious attack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster, striking for 3d6 points of damage. It is able to hit opponents of all types, even those normally subject only to magical weapons of +3 or greater. Creatures without backs (for example, ochre jellies) are not attacked. The faithful hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maximum of one hour plus half an hour per caster level, but once it is activated by an intruder, it lasts only one round per caster level. If the spellcaster is ever more than 30 yards distant from the area that the watchdog guards, the spell ends. The material components of this spell are a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread."

All those affected must resemble the same general type of creature: human, orc, ogre, etc. Each remains a recognizable individual. The effect fails for an individual if the illusion chosen by the caster cannot be accomplished within the spell parameters (for example, a halfling could not be made to look like a centaur, but he might be made to look like a short, young ogre).

Thus, a creature failing to save against a shadow magic fireball must roll another saving throw.

The spell can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust. A sustained force enables the wizard to move a weight of up to 25 pounds a distance up to 20 feet per round. The spell lasts two rounds, plus one round per caster level. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object moved beyond the caster's range falls or stops. If the caster ceases concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. The object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. The caster might even be able to untie simple knots, at the discretion of the DM. Alternatively, the spell energy can be expended in a single round. The caster can hurl one or more objects within range, and within a 10-foot cube, directly away from himself at high speed, to a distance of up to 10 feet per caster level. This is subject to a maximum weight of 25 pounds per caster level. Damage caused by hurled objects is decided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1 point of damage per caster level. Opponents who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. Furthermore, those able to employ as simple a counter-measure as an enlarge spell, for example (thus making the body weight go over the maximum spell limit), can easily counter the spell. The various Bigby's hand spells also counter this spell."

    "Description": "When this spell is used, the wizard instantly transports himself, along with a certain amount of additional weight that is on or being touched by the spellcaster, to a well- known destination. Distance is not a factor, but interplanar travel is not possible by means of a teleport spell. The spellcaster is able to teleport a maximum weight of 250 pounds, plus an additional 150 pounds for each level of experience above the 10th (a 13th-level wizard can teleport up to 700 pounds). If the destination area is very familiar to the wizard (he has a clear mental picture due to previous proximity to and study of the area), it is unlikely that there is any error in arriving, although the caster has no control over his facing upon arrival. Lesser known areas (those seen only magically or from a distance) increase the probability of error. Unfamiliar areas present considerable peril (see table).Probability of Teleporting: Destination Is: High On Target Low Very familiar 01-02 03-99 00 Studied carefully 01-04 05-98 99-00 Seen casually 01-08 09-96 97-00 Viewed once 01-16 17-92 93-00 Never seen 01-32 33-84 85-00 Teleporting high means the wizard arrives 10 feet above the ground for every 1% he is below the lowest \"On Target\" probability; this could be as high as 320 feet if the destination area was never seen. Any low result means the instant death of the wizard if the area into which he teleports is solid. A wizard cannot teleport to an area of empty space--a substantial surface must be there, whether a wooden floor, a stone floor, natural ground, etc. Areas of strong physical or magical energies may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible."

Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it, with the amount of brush required subject to the DM's discretion. The mud remains until a dispel magic spell or a reverse of this spell, mud to rock, restores its substance--but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt, at the rate of 1d6 days per 10 cubic feet.

Likewise, the wall of force is not affected by blows, missiles, cold, heat, electricity, etc. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through it in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. The wizard can, if desired, form the wall into a spherical shape with a radius of up to 1 foot per level or an open hemispherical shape with a radius of 1.5 feet per caster level.

The wall of iron is _-inch thick per level of experience of the spellcaster. The wizard is able to create an iron wall of up to 15 square feet per experience level; thus, a 12th-level wizard can create a wall of iron with an area of 180 square feet. The wizard can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. If the caster desires, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush any creature beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction. This chance can be modified by a force of not less than 30 Strength and 400 pounds mass--each pound over 400 or Strength point over 30 alters the chance by 1% in favor of the stronger side. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saving throws vs. death. Those who fail are killed. Huge and gargantuan creatures cannot be crushed by the wall. The wall is permanent, unless successfully dispelled, but it is subject to all forces a normal iron wall is subject to--rust, perforation, etc. The material component of this spell is a small piece of sheet iron."

The wall of stone is 0.25 inch thick and up to 20 square feet per level of experience of the wizard casting the spell. Thus, a 12th-level wizard can create a wall of stone 3 inches thick and up to 240 square feet in surface area (a 12-foot-wide and 20-foot-high wall, for example, to completely close a 10-foot x 16-foot passage). The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation (see the wall of iron spell); however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the area of effect by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create a span with a surface area of 200 square feet. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenelations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. The stone is permanent unless destroyed by a dispel magic or disintegrate spell, or by normal means such as breaking or chipping. The material component is a small block of granite."

The base chance of success is 50%, modified by the following factors: •+1% per level of the caster •+10% if the caster has seen the same type of substance or object before; this bonus is not cumulative with the following bonus •+20% if the caster has a sample of the material or the same type of object in his possession; this bonus is not cumulative with the bonus above •+30% if the wizard knows the location of the desired object •-50% if the caster has never seen the same type of material or item before If the percentile roll indicates failure, the caster is unable to locate the desired ingredient and the spell ends. If the roll indicates success, the wizard has located the object or substance and the mirror becomes a magical gate through which the caster can see the target. The size of the gate is determined by the size of the mirror, to a maximum size of 3 feet by 2 feet. The gate always appears within arm's length of the target, allowing the wizard to reach through the mirror, grasp the object of his desire, and draw it back through the gate. The wizard must risk his own safety--the gate does not allow the use of probes, long- handled ladles, tongs, or other equipment to gather the material. The caster cannot move completely through the gate. The gate vanishes when the spell's duration expires or when the target or the wizard moves more than 10' away from it. The gate is visible from both sides, and other creatures can reach through the gate. Breath weapons, gaze attacks, missiles, spells, and similar attacks cannot be cast through the gate. Because creatures can pass their limbs through the gate, physical attacks and touch spells can be used. The only limit to the range of this spell is that the caster and the target must be on the same plane of existence. Elemental forces (not creatures) will not pass through the gate. Thus, the wizard does not run the risk of flooding his laboratory by opening a gate beneath the sea, for example. However, the spell does not provide any sort of protection against a hostile environment. The material components are an exquisite silver mirror of no less than 10,000 gp value and a black opal worth at least 1,000 gp which must be powdered and sprinkled on the mirror. The mirror is not lost after casting and may be used again, but the powdered"

Thus, a 9th-level wizard can store three spell levels (three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level spell). Spells that are to be stored in the staff must be memorized normally by the wizard. The spells are then cast as normal when charging the staff; casting requires the spell's normal casting time plus one round. The spell is wiped from memory and material components are consumed. All spells to be stored must be cast into the staff within 1 turn. All stored spells have a casting time of 1. Spells remain in the staff until cast or dispelled, or up to 1 hour per level of the caster. After this time, all stored spells fade away. Only wizards who know the magic staff spell can cast spells from another wizard's staff. This applies to wizards who have never learned or could not normally cast the spells stored in a staff. It is common, however, for the staff's owner to implement a command word which must be known by anyone wishing to use the staff. The material component for this spell is a staff cut from an ash tree. For each spell level the wizard intends to imbue into the staff, it must be inlaid with rubies worth at least 1,000 gp."

This includes damage from a fireball cast in an area too small for its effects, a reflected lightning bolt, or any other offensive area spell that overlaps the safeguarding's area of effect. The protection is effective against spells of 7th level and lower. The protection does not apply to damage from spells rebounded by any form of magical spell turning. This spell does not protect the wizard against damage from spells or attacks cast by enemies or other party members. A wizard who has cast safeguarding is free to move and act normally. The spell's effect is always centered on him, regardless of his actions. Other creatures are free to enter and exit the area of effect. An area spell cast by the wizard will take effect normally, but its effects will be negated within the area of the safeguarding spell.

The spell creates an invisible barrier that blocks the targeted area. Any nonspellcasters and those spellcasters specifically named by the caster may pass freely. All other spellcasters collide with the invisible barrier. Members of classes with lesser spellcasting abilities (paladins, rangers, and bards) are blocked only if the character is of sufficient level to cast spells. The wizard is able to ward one area up to 20'-square for each level of his experience. Thus, a 12th-level wizard may protect a square area 240 feet on a side. The area of effect may be divided among several smaller portals as long as the total area does not exceed the caster's limit. Each portal must be in range and sight of the caster at the time the spell is cast. The barriers exist for one hour per level of the caster unless they are dismissed by the caster or dispelled by a dispel magic spell. A disintegrate spell immediately destroys a barrier, as does a rod of cancellation or a sphere of annihilation. The invisible walls are not affected by physical blows, cold, heat, or electricity. Thrown and projected weapons (both magical and mundane) are not repelled by the barrier and may pass through the area normally. Spells can be cast through the barrier. Dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barriers. The material component is a pinch of dust from any wizard's tomb."

On the second round, a 7'-tall, multicolored tornado appears. From this moment on, the caster must maintain concentration in order for the vortex to remain. Each round, the caster can move the vortex 60 feet. However, control of direction is not perfect. The caster has complete control over distance, but can only suggest the desired direction. The caster has a 50% chance of moving the vortex in the direction he desires; if the die roll indicates failure, the vortex moves according to the scatter diagram for grenade-like missiles. Thus, the vortex usually moves in the general direction desired, but on occasion, it may move to either side or directly toward the caster. The vortex cannot pass through objects larger than its area of effect (it could move through a sapling but not an ancient oak tree) and will be redirected by these, rebounding along the general line of movement. For example, if cast in a narrow hallway, the vortex might ricochet down the hall, bouncing from side to side. The vortex is composed of raw magical energy. Nonmagical creatures struck by the vortex suffer 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster. Magical creatures and spellcasters suffer 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. Creatures struck are allowed a saving throw vs. magic to suffer only half damage. Each time a creature is struck, there is a 5% chance that the vortex will explode in a wild surge. Use Table 2 to determine the results of any wild surge. If the vortex causes a wild surge, the spell ends immediately. The material components are a silk streamer and a handful of straw."

    "Description": "By means of this spell, the wild mage is able to shape and direct the patterns of water currents, allowing him to mold liquids into a variety of forms. The spell affects a quantity of liquid no larger than the area of effect. If cast onto a larger body, such as an ocean or large lake, the spell affects only the water within the area of effect. After casting waveform, the mage can form the water into any desired shape. The spell does not bind the liquid together in any fashion; it is still limited by its fluid properties and gravity. Thus, a mage could not use waveform to create a humanoid creature with arms and legs and direct it to walk across land. He could, however, create a roughly human shape with flowing arms that rises out of the water, crashes forward in a huge splash, then rises and repeats the process. Other possible shapes include gigantic waves, geysers, whirlpools, and troughs. The shape takes one round to form, after which it can be maintained by concentration. The shape can be directed to move in any direction at the rate of 90 feet per round. If the waveform moves into or through a body of water, the form loses no intensity. However, if the wave is moved over dry ground, it loses one die of damage for every 10 feet crossed. If propelled against a target, the waveform causes 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster to creatures in its path. The waveform can be directed against creatures on the surface or underwater. Those struck are allowed a saving throw; success indicates half damage. If the victims are in or on a body of water, the shape will sweep them along. Creatures of small size are carried with the form, moving at its speed. Medium and large size creatures are swept along at half the water's speed. Creatures larger than this resist the movement. Those caught in the current can make a Strength check each round to swim free of the current. Boats and ships are particularly vulnerable to the waveform. If the waveform is twice the size of the vessel or more, the ship must make a seaworthiness check (as described in Table 77 of the DMG ). Vessels passing the check suffer damage as described above, reducing seaworthiness ratings for future checks by 2d6 points until repairs are made. Alternatively, this spell can be cast directly at a single water-based creature--a water weird, water elemental, or other creature from the elemental plane of water. In this case, the spell causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. The effect is instantaneous and the spell ends immediately after the attack is made. The material component is a small, carved oar decorated with aquamarines worth at least 500 gp. The oar disintegrates when the spell is cast."

Such creatures curl into a ball (if more than one undead is affected, they are all gathered into one tightly-packed sphere). Affected undead are held helpless and immobile, their Special abilities in stasis, until the spell expires or the caster frees them. The diameter of this ball of undead is typically 2-3 feet per affected creature. Typically, this \"boneball\" is rolled off a cliff or into an obstacle or fire, or conveyed into the midst of foes, whereupon the caster ends the magic, freeing the undead to fight.

    "Description": "This nasty curse slowly erodes the healthy bone of any chosen creature within range, who is entitled to a saving throw vs. spells. If failed, all bone in the creature slowly begins to dissolve, eventually reducing it to a quivering mound of formless flesh. Except for experiencing a strange \"tingling sensation\" at the time of casting, the victim is not immediately aware of the spell's effect (making it even more insidious). In the short term (starting at the moment of casting up to the first full day), the bones of the victim become embrittled, greatly increasing his or her susceptibility to crushing attacks or falling damage. At the onset, the subject of this spell sustains double normal damage from such attacks; by the end of the first day, the victim's current hit points are reduced by 20%. In the medium term (lasting ld6+l days from the time of the casting), a victim is subject to frequent, painful fractures. All attacks by piercing and slashing weapons inflict double normal damage, while crushing attacks inflict quadruple damage. By the end of this period, the creature's hit points are reduced by 60%. In the terminal stage of this spell, a victim's bones finally dissolve, collapsing the subject's spine and skull, bringing a slow and painful death. While under the effects of this spell, the victim's body is unable to undergo normal healing processes. Magical healing (spells or potions) slows the onset of the terminal stage, but it cannot halt the bone loss process completely. Every 10 hp of magical healing effectively prolongs the victim's life in the intermediate stage of the affliction for one full day. The slow dissolution of bone can only be halted by a successful dispel magic or by remove curse, cure disease, limited wish, wish, heal, or restoration spells. Once the spell has been broken, lost hit points can be healed by normal or magical means. The reverse of the spell, bone growth, immediately halts the bone blight and slowly (over a period of 1-6 days) restores all damage caused by that spell. Bone growth can also be used to fuse normal fractures by accelerating the recipient's normal healing processes. Mild compression fractures heal in a day, while more serious ruptures (such as a broken leg or back) might take 1-4 days to fuse (assuming complete bed rest for the patient; otherwise healing time is doubled). This spell does not affect wounds or soft tissue damage, including cuts and sprains, nor does it correct for improper alignment of the bones while healing. Both versions of this spell only work on living creatures and have no effect if cast on undead. The material component is a drop of aqua regia for bone blight and a drop of milk for bone growth."

Furthermore, the subject does not gain any physical or sensory abilities associated with his new appearance (the spell cannot, for instance, increase the host's physical strength or replace lost eyesight). This application lasts 1 day/level of the caster. For the duration of the spell, grafted flesh literally becomes an extension of the host's own body (affected tissue radiates a faint aura of necromancy, however). The recipient has complete control over the flesh as if it were his or her own. At the conclusion of the spell, the grafted flesh slowly deadens and ultimately drops away. A successful dispel magic ends the spell prematurely. Graft flesh only functions on living human, demihuman, or humanoid subjects. The material component is the host's own severed limb or else a suitable replacement from a fresh corpse (dead for no longer than 1 day per level of the caster). Grafted tissue must be harvested from the same species as the host. Graft flesh cannot be combined with other enchantments (such as embalm or spirit bind) which are used to preserve a corpse. By the conclusion of the spell, all grafted flesh has decayed past all utility and cannot be used in a subsequent casting."

    "Description": "Naturally, this spell is an improvement of the 3rd-level alteration spell blink, allowing the wizard to shift his body to any point within 15 feet of his current location. Unlike the lower-level spell, improved blink allows the wizard to choose the exact time of his jump, the exact destination, and the orientation or facing of his choosing. For example, a wizard confronted by an enemy fighter could blink just before the fighter attacked, reappearing directly behind his foe for a back attack. If the wizard blinks away from an attack, his enemy automatically misses—but creatures with multiple attacks may be able to reposition themselves for another swing if the wizard blinks to a location within reach. If the wizard intends to take any action such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a magical item, he must decide before the round begins if he will do so before or after he blinks. If he acts before he blinks, he may be endangered by an attack before he finishes; he can choose to proceed with his action, hoping that he won’t be hit, or he can abort his action by taking his blink for the round. On the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to the time of his blink to determine when he attacks. A blinking wizard dueling a fighter decides to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then lightning bolt the offensive fellow. The fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so the wizard waits until 6, then blinks, making the fighter miss. At that time, he starts his lightning bolt, which has a casting time of 3—the spell will go off on 9. In the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system, the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink for fast, average, or slow actions. If the fighter above attacked in the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter’s attack, and then his lightning bolt (a fast spell) would go off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions. Because the wizard can pick the location he is blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in order to force it aside—he must blink to an area clear of obstructions or obstacles. If he does attempt to blink into a movable object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the blink 1d8 rules in the PHB for determining where he ends up)."

    "CastingTime": "2 turns",

    "Description": "Similar in most regards to the 4th-level spell Leomund’s secure shelter, this spell offers one significant improvement: The shelter is perfectly camouflaged to blend in with whatever terrain or surroundings are appropriate. It may appear as a house-sized boulder in rocky or mountainous areas, a sand dune, a deadfall, a small grassy knoll, or even a mighty tree. The spell also conceals all telltale signs of habitation, including any smoke, light, or sound coming from within the lodge. Creatures or characters who are exceptionally well-tuned to their surroundings (elves, druids, rangers, and various sylvan monsters) may attempt a saving throw vs. spell to spot the hidden lodge if they pass within 30 feet; all other creatures cannot find the wizard’s refuge without the aid of true seeing or similar magic. In all other respects, the hidden lodge resembles Leomund’s secure shelter. The interior is level, clean, and dry, and the whole thing is sturdily constructed from timber, stone, or sod. It is secure against winds of up to 100 miles per hour, impervious to normal missiles, and the doors, windows, and chimney have the option to be wizard locked and guarded by an alarm spell. Simple furnishings include up to ten bunks, a small writing desk, a trestle table and benches, and an optional unseen servant to wait on the wizard. (If any of the optional secondary spells are added on to this spell, then the casting time goes up to one hour and adds a +3 modifier to the subtlety rating.) The material components are a square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkle of water, and a splinter of wood, plus a crushed diamond worth at least 100 gold pieces. If the secondary spells are to be included, their material components are required also."

    "CastingTime": "1 turn",
    "Duration": "Permanent",
    "Description": "The renowned fire wizard Daltim developed this spell some years ago to protect important items or structures against the various incendiary spells with which he was familiar. Proofing renders an inanimate object nearly impervious to fire, granting the affected item a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. magical fire (including a dragon’s breath), and a +6 bonus to saving throws vs. normal fire. This is cumulative with the saving throw bonus of a magical item, so a cloak of protection +4 could have a bonus of +7 to +10 on any item saving throws versus combustion effects. Remember that an item fails its saving throw on a natural roll of 1, regardless of any bonuses. The item affected must be one discrete construction or object, although it can be articulated or composed of several parts (for example, a suit of armor, a catapult, a house, or a carriage). At 9th level, the wizard can proof an article of clothing or a small piece of furniture; at 12th level, a small vehicle or large piece of furniture; at 15th level, a small building or large vehicle; at 18th level, a medium building or a very large vehicle; and at 20th level or higher, a large building or small fortification. A character dressed in a completely proofed article of clothing (a large cloak) gains a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. fire. The material component for proofing versus combustion is a fire-brick made with the ashes left from a phoenix’s fire. Seafaring wizards often use this spell to protect their vessels from hostile fireballs and various fire-throwing devices."

    "Description": "By casting this spell, the wizard gains the power to corrode ferrous metals and alloys at a touch. Iron and iron-based alloys such as steel, meteoric iron, mithral, and adamantite are affected, but noble metals such as gold, silver, and copper are not subject to reduction through rusting. Any ferrous metal touched by the wizard must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration (usually a 17 or better on a d20) or be destroyed. Magical arms or armor may apply their bonus to this save, so a sword +3 would gain a +3 to its roll. Other magical metal items may receive a +1 to a +6 bonus based on the DM’s estimate of their power. The wizard may employ rusting grasp in combat by simply touching the equipment of metal-wearing characters or creatures. If he tries to touch the armor of a character, the wizard need only hit the opponents unarmored AC. If the armor fails its save, rusting grasp permanently destroys 2d4 points of AC through corrosion. For example, plate mail +3 (base AC 0) could be reduced to a base AC of 2 to 8 if it fails its item saving throw. Weapons are more difficult to grasp; the wizard must make an attack roll against AC 4 (modified by the opponent’s Dexterity) in order to touch the weapon. If the weapon fails its saving throw, it is destroyed. Important note: The wizard must touch the weapon and not the other way around! Unlike a rust monster, he doesn’t corrode weapons simply by being hit. Against metallic creatures, rusting grasp functions like the priest spell cause serious wounds in that it inflicts 2d8+1 point of damage per successful attack. The spell lasts for one round per level, and the wizard can make one touch attack per round. The material component is an antenna from a rust monster."

The beam imparts an immense amount of energy to the object struck, causing it to spontaneously explode. Large, massive objects have more potential destructive energy than small, lightweight objects, but the wizard must hold the beam on the larger object for a longer time in order to cause detonation. The beam has two principal effects: First of all, the object struck is disintegrated if it fails its item saving throw. Secondly, any creature near the destroyed item suffers damage proportional to the weight of the item detonated, plus blast damage of 1d6 points per two caster levels. Creatures caught within the blast radius may attempt a saving throw vs. paralyzation for half damage (1 point per caster level), but the base damage of the explosion may not be saved against.

Objects more massive than 2,000 pounds are simply too big to detonate. Living flesh and enchanted objects or items are immune to the destructive resonance, but a wizard could choose to use Tenser’s destructive resonance on an object worn or carried by another creature. However, if he does so, the victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to negate the beam entirely and prevent any damage at all, and then gains a save for half damage against the blast effect even if the beam succeeds in detonating his equipment. The material component for this spell is a tiny orb of finely-crafted gold with a small removable ring surrounding it that must be taken off as the spell is cast."

    "CastingTime": "1 turn",
    "Duration": "1 hr./level",
    "Description": "This spell conjures a small horde of semitangible magical orbs or eyes that can be used to reconnoiter an area at the wizard’s command. Each of the eyes is about the size of a small apple and can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to the caster’s hand to replay in the caster’s mind everything they have seen during their existence. The eyes are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect the wizard’s ability to receive visual information about his surroundings. The eyes only see as a normal human would— abilities and spell effects including infravision do not alter the eyes’ vision. It only takes the eye one round to replay one hour of recorded images. The spell conjures 1d4 eyes, plus 1 eye per caster level. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level, or until they return to the wizard; after relaying its findings, an eye disappears. Each eye is AC 4, flies by levitation at a rate of 12, and has only 1 hit point— a single hit from any weapon or damaging spell destroys it. A successful dispel magic destroys all eyes caught in the area of effect. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot, especially in conditions of poor visibility such as darkness, fog, or rain. Of course, if the eye is being sent into darkness, then it’s very possible that it could hit a wall or other similar obstacle and destroy itself. When the wizard creates the eyes, he can specify any set of instructions or orders that he wishes, up to 25 words. Any knowledge the wizard possesses is assumed to be known by the eyes as well, so if the wizard knows what a typical Jakallian merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might be, “Surround me at a range of 400 yards and return if you spot any dangerous creatures,” or “Spread out and search the town for Arweth; follow him for three turns, staying out of sight, and then return.” Note that in the first command, the eye only returns if it spots a creature that the wizard would regard as dangerous; a seemingly innocuous peasant that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn’t trigger the eye’s return. In any event, if an eye is ever more than one mile distant from the wizard, it instantly ceases to exist. However, the wizard’s link with the eye is such that he won’t know if the eye was destroyed or if it just wandered out of range. Some command words can be used to abbreviate the directions. For example, “surround me” directs the eyes to form an equally-spaced ring at whatever range is indicated, and then move with the wizard. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. “Spread out” directs the eyes to move away from the wizard in all directions. Other commands that might be useful include having them form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or have them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of the wizard’s directions. The material component is a handful of crystal marbles."

    "Description": "By casting this inherently evil spell, the wizard conjures a small amount of deadly poison directly onto any weapon blades or other surface within the area of effect. The spell creates one dose per caster level; a single dose is sufficient to coat one size S weapon such as a dagger or an arrowhead, three doses can coat a size M weapon, and five doses can coat a size L weapon. The venom remains potent for up to one hour per caster level, although an envenomed blade remains so for only 1d3 successful attacks before the poison has been worn off. The potency of the venom varies by the caster level, as shown below. Level Onset Time Strength 9th 2–12 rounds 20/1d3 12th 2–5 rounds 25/2d4 15th 1–2 rounds 30/2d6 18th+ Immediate death/20 If a weapon coated with Vandarien’s vile venom successfully hits a creature, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or suffer the first damage figure—if the caster was a 12th-level wizard, this would be 25 points. (Naturally, this is damage above and beyond any caused by the weapon that injects the poison.) Even if he succeeds in the save, the victim still sustains a lesser amount of damage, as shown in the second figure. Instead of creating an insinuative poison (one that is introduced to the body through a cut), the wizard can instead conjure the venom as a contact poison. A surface of about one-half square foot per caster level can be affected. One square foot is enough to coat a doorknob, a sword-hilt, the handle or clasp of a chest, or an object of similar size. The contact poison has the same effects as the insinuative venom, but the victim gains a +2 bonus on his saving throws. The contact poison’s toxicity fades at the end of the spell’s duration.

    "Description": "By means of this spell, the wizard surrounds himself with an invisible barrier that moves with him. The space within this barrier is totally impervious to all magic and magical spell effects, thus preventing the passage of spells or their effects. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magical items or spells within its confines. The area is also impervious to breath weapons, gaze or voice attacks, and similar special attack forms. The antimagic shell also hedges out charmed, summoned, or conjured creatures. It cannot, however, be forced against any creature that it would keep at bay; any attempt to do so creates a discernible pressure against the barrier, and continued pressure will break the spell. Normal creatures (a normally encountered troll rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magical sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword. Note that creatures on their home plane are normal creatures there. Thus, on the Elemental Plane of Fire, a randomly encountered fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this spell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. Should the caster be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, parts of his person may be considered exposed, at the DM's option. A dispel magic spell does not remove the spell; the caster can end it upon command."

This disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to get around it. However, the forceful hand also pushes on the opponent. This force can push away a creature weighing 500 pounds or less, slow movement to 10 feet per round if the creature weighs between 500 and 2,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if the creature weighs more than 2,000 pounds. A creature pushed away is pushed to the range limit, or until pressed against an unyielding surface. The hand itself inflicts no damage. The forceful hand has an Armor Class of 0, has as many hit points as its caster in full health, and vanishes when destroyed.

    "Duration": "Instantaneous",
    "Description": "This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke of lightning, 2_ feet wide, commencing from the fingertips of the caster. Unlike a lightning bolt spell, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to a series of other objects or creatures within range, losing energy with each jump. The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell). After the first strike, the lightning arcs to the next nearest object or creature. Each jump reduces the strength of the lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success on this save indicates the creature suffers only half damage from the bolt. The chain can strike as many times (including the first object or creature) as the spellcaster has levels, although each creature or object can be struck only once. Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can strike up to 12 times, causing less damage with each strike. The bolt continues to arc until it has struck the appropriate number of objects or creatures, until it strikes an object that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of a large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, etc.), or until there are no more objects or creatures to strike. Direction is not a consideration when plotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a factor- -an arc cannot exceed the spell's range. If the only possible arc is greater than the spell's range, the stroke fades into nothingness. Creatures immune to electrical attack can bestruck, even though no damage is taken. Note that it is possible for the chain to arc back to the caster! The material components are a bit of fur, a piece of amber, glass, or crystal rod, and one silver pin for each experience level of the caster."

Count every +1 hit point bonus of a creature as _ of a Hit Die; thus, a creature with 4+3 Hit Dice equals a 4 _ Hit Dice creature. The conjured animal(s) remain for one round for each level of the conjuring wizard, or until slain. They follow the caster's verbal commands.

The contingency spell and the spell it is to bring into effect are cast at the same time (the one-turn casting time indicated is the total for both castings). The spell to be brought into effect by the prescribed contingency must be one that affects the wizard's person (feather fall, levitation, fly, feign death, etc.) and be of a spell level no higher than 1/3 of the caster's experience level (rounded down), but not higher than the 6th spell level. Caster Level Contingency Spell Level 12-14 4th 15-17 5th 18+ 6th Only one contingency spell can be placed on the spellcaster at any one time; if asecond is cast, the first one (if still active) is cancelled. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be rather general. For example, a contingency spell cast with an airy water spell might prescribe that any time the wizard is plunged into or otherwise engulfed in water or similar liquid, the airy water spell will instantly come into effect. Or a contingency could bring a feather fall spell into effect any time the wizard falls more than 2 feet. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the second spell, the latter being \"cast\" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. Note that if complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell complex (the contingency spell and the companion magic) may fail when called upon. The material components of this spell are (in addition to those of the companion spell) 100 gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature. In addition, the spell requires a statuette of the wizard carved from elephant ivory (which is not destroyed, though it is subject to wear and tear), which must be carried on the person of the spellcaster for the contingency spell to perform its function when called upon."

The upper-cased headings represent the existing weather conditions. The small headings beneath each large heading are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. Furthermore, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear and warm with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm.

    "Description": "When a death spell is cast, it snuffs out the life forces of creatures in the area of effect instantly and irrevocably. Such creatures cannot be raised or resurrected, but an individual slain in this manner might be brought back via a wish. The number of creatures that can be slain is a function of their Hit Dice. Maximum # of Creatures' Hit Dice Creatures Affected Under 2 4d20 2 to 4 2d20 4+1 to 6+3 2d4 6+4 to 8+3 1d4 If creatures of differing Hit Dice are attacked with a death spell, roll the dice (4d20) to determine how many creatures of under 2 Hit Dice are affected. If the number rolled is greater than the actual number of sub-2 Hit Dice creatures, apply the remainder of the roll to the higher Hit Dice creatures by consulting the following table. Creatures' Hit Dice Conversion Factor (CF) Under 2 1 2 to 4 2 4+1 to 6+3 10 6+4 to 8+3 20 In other words, from the 4d20 roll subtract the number of creatures of less than 2 Hit Dice (these creatures die). If there are any remaining points from the 4d20 roll, subtract 2 for each creature of 2 to 4 Hit Dice (these creatures also die). If this still doesn't use up all the 4d20 roll, subtract 10 for each creature of 4+1 to 6+3 Hit Dice, and so on. Stop when all the creatures are dead, all the 4d20 roll is used up, or the remainder is less than half the CF of any remaining creatures. (If the remainder is one-half or more of the CF of a creature, that creature dies.) For example, a mixed group of 20 goblins, eight gnolls, and four ogres, led by a hill giant, are caught in the area of a death spell. The 4d20 roll gives a total of 53 points; 20 of this eliminates the goblins (20 x 1 CF), 16 kills the gnolls (8 x 2 CF), and the remaining 17 kills two ogres (10 points to kill one ogre, and the remaining 7 points are enough to kill one more ogre). The other two ogres and the hill giant are unharmed. A death spell does not affect lycanthropes, undead creatures, or creatures from planes other than the Prime Material. The material component of this spell is a crushed black pearl with a minimum value of 1,000 gp."

    "AoE": "1 item",
    "CastingTime": "Special",
    "Duration": "Special",
    "Description": "This is a spell that must be used by a wizard planning to create a magical item. The enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic. The item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100 gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted. The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to thefabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process. The item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.) At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again. Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if the prior spell failed. No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.--can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose. The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of ki- rin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play."

    "Duration": "Special",
    "Description": "Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a powerful creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to perform one service in return for freedom from the ensnarement spell. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated, and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the ensnarement spell. The spell causes an awareness of a gatelike opening on the plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The score is modified by the difference between the creature's Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added to the dice roll. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is ensnared. When so trapped, the otherplanar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). Even with such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spellcaster. A hand-drawn circle has a base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of 10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the difference between the wizard's combined Intelligence and experience level and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free. The chance can be further reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the hand- made circle is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation. This can bring the base chance to 0%. Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it. Once safely ensnared, the creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. (Remember the danger of something breaking the ward!) The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature. The DM will then assign a value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful Intelligencecheck against its adjusted Intelligence, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature's Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some riddance spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. Once the single service is completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be instantly sent from whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge."

This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. For example, a 12th-level caster who chose fear would have four opportunities to make gaze attacks causing fear, one for each round of the spell's duration. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows: Charm: The wizard can charm a single person or monster by gaze and by uttering a single word. The effect is to make the charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a charm monster spell. All creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses. Fear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze and by speaking a single word. The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After this, the creature refuses to face the caster and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if subsequently confronted by the caster (50% chance of either). The latter effect lasts one turn per caster level. This attack can be negated by spells that counter fear. Sicken: This power enables the caster to merely gaze, speak, a word, and cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject's body. Creatures with ability scores function at half effectiveness; others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. Movement isat one-half normal rate. The subject remains stricken for one turn per level of the caster, after which all abilities return at the rate of one point per turn of complete rest or one point per hour of moderate activity. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse or successful dispel magic spell is effective. Creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses versus this attack. Sleep: The wizard can cause any individual to fall into a comatose slumber by means of a gaze and a single word, unless the subject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st-level sleep spell save with -2 penalties. An affected creature must be shaken or otherwise shocked back to consciousness. In all cases, the gaze attack has a speed factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead of any type, or extend beyond the plane occupied by the caster. Note that the caster is subject to the effects of his reflected gaze and is allowed any applicable saving throw. In the case of a reflected charm gaze, the caster is paralyzed until it wears off or is countered."

The creature must be intelligent, conscious, under its own volition, and able to understand the caster. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that are likely to result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of action. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed. Failure to do so will cause the creature to grow sick and die within 1d4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of the instructions causes a corresponding loss of Strength points until the deviation ceases. A geas can be done away with by a wish spell, but a dispel magic or remove curse spell will not negate it. Your DM will decide any additional details of a geas, for its casting and fulfillment are tricky, and an improperly cast geas is ignored."

All corridors become misty; visibility is reduced to 10 feet. 2. All doors are wizard locked. 3. Stairs are filled with webs from top to bottom. These act as the 2nd-level web spell, except that they regrow within one turn if destroyed. 4. Where there are choices in direction--such as a cross or side passage--a minor confusion-type spell functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the exact opposite direction. 5. The whole area radiates magic. The normal use of the detect magic spell becomes impossible for those of less than the caster's level and difficult for others. 6. One door per level of experience of the wizard is covered by an illusion to appear as if it were a plain wall.7. The wizard can place one of the following additional magical effects: A. Dancing lights in four corridors. B. A magic mouth in two places. C. A stinking cloud in two places. D. A gust of wind in one corridor or room. E. A suggestion in one place. Note that items 6 and 7 function only when the wizard is totally familiar with the area of the spell's effect. Dispel magic can remove one effect, at random, per casting. A remove curse spell will not work.

If only detailed information on the person, place, or thing is known, casting time is 1d10 days. If only rumors are known, casting time is 2d6 weeks. During the casting, the wizard cannot engage in activities other than the routine: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination reveals if legendary material is available. It often reveals where this material is--by place name, rhyme, or riddle. Itsometimes gives certain information regarding the person, place, or thing (when the object of the legend lore is at hand), but this data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). Naturally, a legend lore spell reveals information only if the person, place, or thing is noteworthy or legendary. For example, suppose Delsenora came across an extremely well-made sword. It radiates magic, but when she used an identify spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a trusted fighter didn't work, as the sword did not reveal any special powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, hoping to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, \"Once this was the sword of he who waits till Albion's time of greatest peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.\" Clearly, Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow. The legend lore spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item of value to the caster must be sacrificed in addition--a potion, magical scroll, magical item, etc."

The water can be lowered up to 2 feet for every experience level of the wizard, to a minimum depth of 1 inch. The water is lowered within a square area whose sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus, a 12th-level wizard affects a volume of 24 feet x 120 feet x 120 feet, a 13th-level caster a volume of 26 feet x 130 feet x 130 feet, and so on. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell: The creature moves at half speed and makes half the number of attacks each round. It has no effect on other creatures. The material component of this spell is a small vial of dust. Its reverse, raise water, causes water or similar fluids to return to their highest natural level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This can make fords impassable, float grounded ships, and may even sweep away bridges, at the DM's option. It negates lower water and vice versa. The material component of the raise water spell is a small vial of water."

In its more complex form, where a material component is used, detection is possible only by some magical means, whether device, item, or spell. Either form of mirage arcana is subject to the dispel magic spell. As with all powerful illusions, the mind of the believer urges appropriate effects upon the viewer's body. Under the influence of the spell, the viewer could possibly walk across a bed of hot coals thinking it was a shallow stream of water that was cooling his feet (and thus suffer no damage), dine upon imaginary food and actually be satisfied, or rest comfortably upon a bed of sharp stones, thinking it a featherbed. Gravity is not affected by the spell, however, so an envisioned bridge spanning a deep chasm does not supportthe believer. Those who witness the event see it as a sudden disappearance of the individual. They do not connect it with an illusion unless they are otherwise aware of some magic at work."

The wizard is then free to go elsewhere while his double seemingly moves away. The spell enables the illusion of the wizard to speak and gesture as if it were real, and there are full olfactory and touch components as well. A true seeing spell or a gem of seeing will reveal the illusion for what it is. A detect invisibility or true seeing spell or items such as a gem of seeing or robe of eyes can detect the invisible wizard (see the 5th-level wizard spell shadow door)."

    "Description": "When cast, the move earth spell moves dirt (clay, loam, sand) and its other components. Thus, embankments can be collapsed, hillocks moved, dunes shifted, etc. However, in no event can rock prominences be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected dictates the casting time; for every 40 yard x 40 yard surface area and 10 feet of depth, one turn of casting time is required. The maximum area that can be affected is 240 yards x 240 yards, which takes four hours. If terrain features are to be moved--as compared to simply caving in banks or walls of earth--it is necessary that an earth elemental be subsequently summoned to assist. All spell casting or summoning must be completed before any effects occur. As any summoned earth elemental will perform most of its work underground, it is unlikely that it will be intercepted or interrupted. Should this occur, however, the movement of the earth requiring its services must be stopped until the elemental is once again available. Should the elemental be slain or dismissed, the move earth spell is limited to collapsing banks or walls of earth. The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures; its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle. The material components for this spell are a mixture of soils (clay, loam, sand) in a small bag and an iron blade. Note: This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, etc. are relatively unaffected, save for changes in elevation and relative topography."

    "Description": "Otiluke's Freezing Sphere is a multipurpose spell of considerable power. If the caster opts, he may create any of the following: A) Frigid globe. A small globe of matter at absolute zero temperature that spreadsupon contact with water, or a liquid that is principally water, freezing it to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the spellcaster. This ice lasts for one round per level of the caster. The material component is a thin sheet of crystal about an inch square. B) Cold ray. The spell can be used as a thin ray of cold that springs from the caster's hand to a distance of 10 yards per level of the wizard; this ray inflicts 1d4+2 points of damage per level of the caster upon the first creature struck. A saving throw vs. spell is applicable; all damage is negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed). If the first creature is missed, the path of the ray is plotted to its full distance, and anything else in its path must save (if applicable) or suffer appropriate damage. The material component is a white sapphire of not less than 1,000 gp value. C) Globe of cold. This creates a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, but not harmful. This globe can be hurled, either by hand to a distance of 40 yards (considered short range), or as a sling bullet. The globe shatters upon impact, inflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10-foot radius (one-half damage if a saving throw vs. spell is successful). Use the Grenadelike Missile Table in the Dungeon Master Guide to find where misses strike. Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within one round per level of the spellcaster, it shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although it can prove hazardous to the spellcaster and his associates as well. The material component is a 1,000-gp diamond."

The depth and length of the trough are dependent upon the level of the wizard, and a trough 3 feet deep by 10 yards long is created per level. For example, at 12th level the wizard would part water 36 feet deep by 20 feet wide by 120 yards long. The trough remains as long as the spell lasts or until the wizard who cast it opts to end its effects. If cast under water, this spell creates an air cylinder of appropriate length and diameter. If cast directly on a water elemental or other water-based creature, the creature receives 4d8 damage and must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or flee in panic for 3d4 rounds. The material components for the spell are two small sheets of crystal or glass."

The occurrence that begins the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, such as the following: \"Begin only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits cross-legged within one foot of this spot.\" Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 12th-level wizard can command the programmed illusion to occur at a maximum encounter range of 60 yards. A programmed illusion cannot distinguish invisible creatures, nor alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word. The spell lasts until the illusion occurs; thus, the spell duration is variable.

The image can be dispelled only by means of a successful dispel magic spell (or upon command from the spellcaster); attacks pass harmlessly through it. The image must be within view of the wizard projecting it at all times, and if his sight is obstructed, the spell is broken. Note that if the wizard is invisible at the time the spell is cast, the image is also invisible until the caster's invisibility ends, though the wizard must still be able to see the image (by means of a detect invisibility spell or other method) to maintain the spell. If the wizard uses dimension door, teleport, plane shift, or a similar spell that breaks his line of vision, the project image spell ends.

Those who view the shades and fail their saving throws vs. spell believe the illusion. The shades perform as the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do not actually occur, but a subject who believes the shades are real will react appropriately, until the illusion iscountered by a dispel magic spell or the condition is countered by a heal spell.

Such flesh is inert, lacking a vital life force, unless a life force or magical energy is available (for example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a body). If cast upon stone, the wizard can create a cylinder of fleshy material from 1 to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long, allowing a passage to be made. The material components are a pinch of earth and a drop of blood. The reverse, flesh to stone, turns flesh of any sort to stone. All possessions on the person of the creature likewise turn to stone. The intended subject of the spell receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If a statue created by this spell is subjected to breakage or weathering, the being (if ever returned to his original, fleshy state) will have similar damage, deformities, etc. The DM may allow such damage to be repaired by various high-level clerical spells, such as regenerate.

The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic proportions, so he becomes a formidable fighting machine; the spell causes the caster to become a berserk fighter! The wizard's hit points double, and all damage he sustains comes first from the magical points gained; once these points are eliminated, all subsequent damage (to his true hit points) is doubled. The Armor Class of the wizard is 4 better than that possessed prior to casting the spell (AC 10 goes to 6, AC 9 to 5, AC 8 to 4, etc.), to a maximum Armor Class of -10. All attacks are as a fighter of the same level as the wizard (i.e., the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved for fighters). The wizard can use either a dagger or a staff when attacking. A dagger can be used twice per round, and each successful attack inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. A staff can be used only once per round, but with a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. The wizard fights in melee in preference to all other forms of attack, and continues attacking until all opponents are slain, he is killed, the magic is dispelled, or the spell duration expires. The material component for casting this spell is a potion of heroism (or superheroism) that the wizard must consume during the course of uttering the spell."

If water remains in contact with the transmuted dust, the former quickly soaks the latter, turning the dust into silty mud (if a sufficient quantity of water exists to do so), otherwise soaking or dampening the dust accordingly. Only liquid actually in the area of effect at the moment of spellcasting is affected. Liquids that are only partially water are affected only insofar as the actual water content is concerned; however, potions containing water are rendered useless. Living creatures are unaffected, except for those native to the Elemental Plane of Water. Such creatures receive saving throws vs. spell. Failure inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level upon the subject, while success means the creature receives half damage. Only one such creature can be affected by any single casting of this spell, regardless of the creature's size or the size of the spell's area of effect.

The subject can burrow as an umber hulk, cutting through 10 feet of solid stone or 60 feet of soil per turn. The only limitation to this is the subject's stamina; at the end of each turn of burrowing, the subject must succeed a Constitution check or be forced to rest for one turn. Burrowing through soil does not necessarily create a passable tunnel. If the subject wishes to make a passage in which others can travel or that he can exit when the spell ends, he must dig at a rate of 30 feet per turn. Cutting a tunnel through solid rock does not require extra care or time. The recipient of this spell can make two claw attacks per round, each inflicting 2d6 points of damage plus any Strength bonuses. Each attack is made with a -2 penalty to hit. This penalty applies until the subject has made two successful consecutive attacks (not necessarily in the same round), at which time he is accustomed to using the claws.

Any creature within 20 feet of the tentacle is subject to attack as directed by the caster. The victim must attempt a saving throw; if successful, the subject has avoided entanglement, but suffers 1d6 points of fire damage from contact with the tendril. If the saving throw is failed, the victim is entangled by the flaming serpent and suffers 3d6 points of fire damage each round until the tendril is destroyed or the spell expires.

Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw to resist the shadowy transformation. Magical items and the magical effects of spells (such as Bigby's forceful hand or a wall of stone ) cannot be affected. A transformed creature and all its gear become insubstantial. The creature can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and the smallest cracks. The creature cannot fly without additional magic. No form of attack is possible when in shadow form except against creatures that exist on the Ethereal plane. In this case, all attacks are normal; however, the shadowy creature may be harmed only by magical weapons of +1 or greater or by creatures able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. Spells and special attacks have normal effects. Most undead creatures will ignore a creature in shadow form, believing it to be a wraith or spectre; however, liches and powerful undead may save vs. spell with a -4 penalty to recognize the spell. A successful dispel magic spell forces the creature in shadow form back to normal form."

The wildshield protects the caster from the effects of spells and magical items. The shield can completely absorb 2d6 spell levels (i.e., if the roll of 2d6 results in 10, the shield could absorb ten 1st-level spells, two 5th-level spells, or any similar combination), thereby negating their effects on the caster. Both area effect spells and those individually targeted at the wild mage can be absorbed. In the case of area spells, the wildshield protects only the mage. All others in the area of effect suffer normal effects from the spell. Wildshield also protects against wild surges, whether caused by the caster's magic or by an outside source. Each wild surge is considered equal to 1d6 spell levels. The spell remains in effect until it is either canceled by the caster or it reaches its spell level capacity. If the capacity is met exactly, the wildshield simply ceases to function. However, if the wildshield is struck by more spell levels than it can absorb, it explodes in a wild surge. The spell that triggered the surge is completely negated, its energy instead transformed into a wild surge (see Table 2). Since the shield no longer functions, the formerly protected wizard is subject to full effects of this wild surge. The material component is a small sponge."

Blackmantle is negated for any target creatures who make successful saving throws. Otherwise, it persists for 1 turn per level of the caster. If the creatures are still alive at the end of the spell's duration, any active curative forces will operate normally; for instance, a ring of regeneration will resume its function. However, consuming a potion of healing or applying a staff of curing while blackmantle is in effect will have no affect when blackmantle wears off, since these types of magic work instantly. In such cases, the dose of potion of healing and the charge from a staff of curing are not only wasted, but the aura generated by blackmantle actually negates the potion of healing or the staff of curing, rendering it useless. If a potion of healing or staff of healing is applied after the spell wears off, the healing magic works normally.

If the caster's gaze is reflected back on him (by a mirror, calm water, etc.), he must make a saving throw vs. spells or suffer the same effects as a 5+ Hit Dice victim.

One tentacle grows on each side of the caster's body, centered between his armpit and his thigh. The caster can use the tentacles as normal appendages to grasp tools, use weapons, or help with climbing. Each tentacle can make an attack, effectively giving the caster two extra attacks per round; a tentacle can strike to inflict 1-6 hit points of damage, or it can wield a sword, dagger, or other weapon (at the same ability of the caster). The flexible tentacles can easily reach victims on any side of the caster's body. If an unarmed tentacle makes a successful strike against a victim who is man-sized or smaller (less than 7 feet tall), it also grabs and holds the victim to inflict an automatic 2-8 (2d4) hit points of damage in every subsequent round. To free himself, the victim must sever the tentacle; there is no way to loosen the grip other than severing the member, killing the caster, or negating the spell with dispel magic. A tentacle is severed if it takes 10 hit points of damage; damage directed at the tentacle has no adverse effects on the caster. A caster with two intact tentacles adds a 40 percent bonus modifier to his climbing success rate (see page 122 of the Player's Handbook, ) and adds a 20 percent modifier if he has only one intact tentacle. The material component for this spell is a dried tentacle from a small octopus"

    "Description": "This spell enables an individual touched by the caster to transfer his or her life force to temporarily animate the fresh corpse of a human, demihuman, or humanoid. This spell will fail if cast on undead. The recipient wills the cadaver to move and act and can even cast spells through it—all while his or her own body is safely up to 5 miles away per level of the caster. While animated by the host's life force, the corpse ceases to decay; however, unless illusionary magic is cast upon it, the cadaver will appear to be a form of undead (such a ju-ju zombie). The recipient (who may be the caster) can see, hear, and sense through the corpse host. The host can fight, talk hoarsely (with the voice of the corpse), and carry things—in fact, it can perform all tasks less exacting than lock-picking, sewing, and similar handicrafts. It can even go adventuring and earn experience points for its \"master.\" The recipient's mind functions in two places simultaneously within the corpse host and within his or her real body. The real body can still sense (see, hear, and so on) exactly as before, even benefiting from enhancements such as a magical ring. The tradeoff is paralysis. Aside from breathing, blinking, and moving his or her eyes, the recipient cannot move his or her real body while the host is animated. (Friendly guards are a wise precaution. So is a pleasant or strategic view). The real body does not need to eat, drink, or sleep. The recipient is vulnerable when his or her corpse host is the target of magical and psionic powers thataffect the mind. The host can be fooled by illusion spells to the same degree as the recipient. It works this way because both recipient and host are actually sharing the same mind. Physical attacks against the corpse host don't damage the real body, though they do harm the host. The latter has a number of \"hit points\" equal to the recipient's normal maximum (even if the recipient is currently crippled). The host has the recipient's natural armor class (10), though it may wear armor and employ weaponry with the same restrictions that apply to the recipient. The host does not benefit from anything worn or carried by the recipient's real body, however. The corpse host can withstand attacks as well as (or as poorly as) the recipient can normally. Note that since the host is not undead, it may not be turned or affected with spells or magical items that influence such creatures. If the host drops to 0 or fewer hit points, the owner must make a system shock roll. Failure indicates that the real body also dies along with the host. The spiritual link between the recipient and host can also be abruptly severed by (successfully) casting the wizard spells dispel magic, limited wish or wish or by employing the clerical spells spirit release or dispel evil. Severance of the spiritual link also requires the recipient to make a system shock roll in order to survive the ordeal. The recipient of this spell can abandon the link with the corpse host at any time, with no harm to him- or herself. The host immediately collapses (resuming its usual decay), and the recipient immediately regains control of his or her real body. The same thing occurs when the spell ends or the corpse host somehow moves beyond the spell's range or to another plane. The material components include a fresh corpse (of an individual who has been dead for no longer than 1 day per level of the caster) and a freshly-excised patch of the recipient's skin. Harvesting this piece of flesh from the subject at the time of casting also inflicts 1-3 hit points of damage. At the conclusion of the spell, the recipient is entitled to a saving throw vs. death magic. If failed, the hit point loss is permanent (consumed by the spell) and cannot be reversed or magically healed except with awish or restoration spell. If successful, the loss in hit points, while temporary, can only be regained by normal rest."

    "Description": "This rare and horrible spell causes the victim to be slowly transformed into a ravening, flesh-eating ghoul (see the description in the MONSTROUS MANUAL for all about the lives of ghouls). The transformation process usually begins at the limb or extremity (usually the hand or arm) closest to the location touched by the caster at the onset of the spell. The victim suffers 1-2 hit points of damage each round while the body slowly dies and transforms into a ghoul's cold, undying flesh. The victim is entitled to an initial saving throw to resist this deadly transformation. If failed, only a limited wish, wish, or restoration will end the condition. A dispel magic or remove curse may be effective, but only if cast within three rounds of the touch that confers the ghoul gauntlet. During the early stages of the spell, the original afflicted extremity may be severed and burned to terminate the spell. If the extremity affected by the ghoul gauntlet is amputated while the victim has lost less than 20% of hisor her total hit points, then only a hand or a foot may need to be severed (inflicting ld4+l hp of damage, requiring a system shock roll to remain conscious, and resulting in the loss of the limb's mobility and functions). After the victim has lost 20%-50% of his or her hit points, however, an entire limb will have to be cut off, with the loss of ldl2+4 hp and a system shock roll. Initially, the transformed flesh of the victim has no paralytic powers or any of the special abilities associated with ghouls. As the spell unfolds, the advancing front of dying flesh inexorably traverses the entire body, and the victim immediately dies once the ghoul gauntlet reaches the heart or brain (upon reaching 0 hp due to the spell). Healing spells, potions, or magical items have no power to cure or reverse this affliction while the ghoul gauntlet runs its course. One full day after the victim has died (unless the remains are burned), the subject awakens as a fullfledged ghoul as outlined in the MONSTROUS MANUAL. The undead is now a fawning slave, utterly under the control of the necromancer who cast the nefarious spell. The material components include the freshly harvested fingernail of a corpse and a pinch of mandrake root. Both of these are consumed by the casting of the spell."

The spell may be cast only upon dead, inanimate bones; after they have been transmuted, the bones may now be animated by the usual means. Despite their increased strength, the bones do not change in appearance, and they retain their original weight. Bone objects make all future saving throws as if they were hard metal (DMG, page 39). Transmuted skeletons now have AC 3 and take half the usual damage from physical attacks. However, these skeletons still take normal damage from holy water and magical attacks and are also subject to spells affecting metal {transmute metal to wood or heat metal) and the attacks of creatures that especially affect metal, such as rust monsters. The reverse of this spell, transmute steel to bone, weakens any metal by making it as brittle as dry bone (altering all saving throws appropriately). Each non-living recipient of this spell must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration. If failed, the former metal item makes all future saves as if it were fashioned from bone. Metal armor loses its effectiveness, becoming AC 7. Whenever a successful hit is made by or upon the item, the transmuted object must make a save vs. crushing blow to remain intact and functional. Magic items weakened by this spell remain magical, with any bonuses applied to their saving throws. Weapons affected by this spell inflict -2 hp per die of damage (and must save to avoid breakage whenever they hit a target). Physical attacks versus transmuted metal creatures inflict +2 hp per die of damage. The material components (for both versions of the spell) are steel filings and powdered bone."

The wizard may then throw or fire the weapon in the normal fashion, or he can choose to give it to a companion to use. If the wizard employs the arrow of bone himself, he strikes with the THAC0 of a warrior of half his own level and a +3 bonus to his attack roll; if he gives it to someone else, the bone arrow merely confers a +1 bonus to hit. A creature struck by the weapon must make a saving throw vs. death magic or die; even if successful, the victim sustains normal damage for the missile, plus an additional number of points equal to the weapon’s maximum damage (for example, 1d6+6 for an arrow or javelin, or 1d3+3 for a dart). Unlike the death spell or finger of death, the victim can be raised or resurrected in any expedient manner. The arrow of bone does not destroy undead or nonliving creatures outright. Instead, the arrow inflicts normal damage plus four times the missile’s normal maximum (1d6+24 for an arrow, 1d3+12 for a dart, and so on), or half that if the subject creature succeeds in its saving throw. The material component is a powdered sliver of bone mixed with black dragon blood. The resulting mixture is used to paint runes on the weapon. If the splinter of bone can be taken from the remains of a close blood relative of the subject (a sibling, parent, or grandparent), the victim receives a –4 penalty on his or her saving throw if struck by the arrow of bone."

    "Description": "This spell makes a single weapon incredibly sharp by reducing one of its physical dimensions to an infinitesimal measurement. The dimensional blade can slash through matter with as much effort as it takes to wave a stick through the air. Even stone and iron can be carved to pieces with ease. The spell can be cast on almost any hand-held slashing (type S) weapon, as well as a few thrown weapons of this type, such as the chakram, shuriken, or a hand axe. Against creatures, the dimensional blade ignores any portion of Armor Class derived from armor itself; only magical and Dexterity adjustments affect the opponent’s AC. For example, a warrior in chain mail +2 with a Dexterity of 17 is normally AC 0, but against the dimensional blade he only applies the 3-point adjustment for Dexterity and the 2-point magical adjustment, for a total AC of 5. Creatures wearing purely magical armor (such as bracers of defense) may keep the full magical adjustment. Monsters with thick or toughened hides, such as dragons, may lose part of the Armor Class at the DM’s discretion. The weapon gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls in any event, but the wielder ignores any Strength-based combat adjustments—muscle power doesn’t help the blade at all. The dimensional blade is also quite effective against inanimate objects. Any object with a diameter or thickness smaller than the blade’s length must make a saving throw vs. disintegration when struck, or be cleanly severed in twain. Larger objects can be sawed through or sliced away at the rate of about 5 cubic feet per round. It’s dangerous to attempt to disarm a dimensional blade; the weapon used must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration or be destroyed. Finally, the blade is also effective against phased or ethereal creatures since part of its existence is forced into the Ethereal Plane. If the wielder has some way to detect creatures concealed in this way, the blade can strike and affect them normally, but without the power to negate Armor Class or other combat bonuses. The wizard must touch the weapon to be affected by the spell, but afterward anyone may wield it. The material component for this spell is a razor-thin shard of glass."

No physical, or magical attack can affect him, unless his assailant is ethereal as well (although some monsters, such as the basilisk, have gaze weapons whose power extends into the Ethereal Plane). The spell recipients are actually in the Border Ethereal and can still perceive their physical surroundings, but the world appears gray, misty, and indistinct to them.

He will have to use this spell again or find another way back in order to return to his home plane. The wizard can attempt to use etherealness to banish an unwilling subject. He must make a successful attack roll in order to touch him, and the subject receives a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. An unwilling subject automatically remains in the Border Ethereal for an amount of time specified by the wizard at the time of the casting, but no more than one hour per caster level.

    "Description": "A more potent form of the lesser sign of sealing, this spell allows the caster to guard an item or portal and prevent all other creatures from opening or passing through the sealed item or surface. The greater sign has several effects; first of all, it affects a doorway or item that opens (a chest, for instance) as a wizard lock spell. If placed in an open corridor or archway to prevent passage, the greater sign creates a magical barrier that repels all who try to pass. Second, the greater sign greatly strengthens the physical structure of any door or item it is placed upon, granting a +6 bonus on any item saving throws and allowing the item or door to ignore 1 point of damage per caster level from any attack. For example, a greater sign cast by a 12th-level wizard would reduce the damage of any blow or spell by 12 points, so a fighter armed with a broad sword (maximum damage of 8 points) could never hack through a door protected by the sign. Finally, if the protected doorway or item is forced open or destroyed by any means, the sign itself is not only destroyed, but also releases a spell upon the offending creature. The spell held by the sign is cast into the ward when the greater sign is created, and any spell the caster has memorized may be used in this way, from a fireball or shocking grasp to a very nasty wish or polymorph. The range of the sign’s retributive spell is 10 yards per caster level, so it is possible to destroy the warding from a safe distance. The sign is displayed in plain sight, and most wizards will recognize it for what it is. The caster cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the sign’s operation; it functions against any creature that attempts to pass it, although the wizard can freely pass through his own sign without activating it. The greater sign can be removed by the caster, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated by a limited wish or wish spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster; it cannot be dispelled. The material component for a greater sign is a powdered diamond worth at least 1,000 gold pieces."

    "Description": "When this spell is cast, the wizard designates one inanimate object of stone, earth, or metal within the spell’s range to function as a powerful magnet, attracting all metal. The object affected can be no larger than a 10-foot cube, although a section of wall, floor, or ceiling about 10 square feet will work. Once magnetized, the object exerts a powerful attractive or repulsive force (caster’s choice) against objects of ferrous metal. The effects vary by the proximity of the metal objects to the center of magnetism, as shown below: Distance to Movement Rate Effective Missile Attack Magnetism per Round Strength Penalty 10 feet or less 40 feet 22 (Garg.) –40 20 feet or less 20 feet 20 (Huge) –20 30 feet or less 10 feet 18 (Large) –10 40 feet or less 5 feet 14 (Medium) –5 50 feet or less 2 feet 10 (Small) –2 60 feet or less 1 foot 4 (Tiny) –1 The movement rate represents how fast objects are drawn to or repelled from the center of magnetism. If the creature or object in question is heavier than the magnetized item, the magnetized item does the moving instead. The effective Strength is the “pull” of the magnetism at that range; the size equivalent refers to creature sizes, not weapon sizes. (All human-sized weapons are considered small or tiny for this chart). A character or creature carrying loose metal items or objects such as weapons, shields, helms, buttons, and so on must win an opposed Strength check (see Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics for information on opposed ability checks) in order to keep his possessions from being wrenched out of his grasp by the magnetism. Securing a weapon in its sheath, holding an item with both hands, and other precautions may give the character a +2 to +4 to his base ability score, at the DM’s discretion. Characters wearing metal armor must attempt an opposed Strength check to ignore the effects of the magnetism. If the character fails his Strength check outright, he loses his footing and flies towards or away from the object at the full rate indicated. He suffers full falling damage based on the speed with which he hits the item—1d6 for every 10 feet of the movement rate, or half that damage if he is repelled and simply thrown back onto the ground. If the character passes his Strength check but is beaten by the magnetism roll, he is moved one foot for each point he lost by. Again, some precautions or assistance may help iron-wearing characters in their Strength checks. For monsters, compare the creature’s size to the effective size of magnetism. An armored character who is stuck to a surface or object loses any Dexterity adjustments to AC and cannot make any physical attacks. He can try to wriggle out of his armor and free himself, employ a magical item, or use psionic powers if he has any at his disposal. Lodestone the fighter is charging a wizard when the dastardly felon magnetizes a sizable boulder about 30 feet from Lodestone’s present position. Lodestone carries a long sword, a shield, and wears plate mail; he has a Strength of 17. First, he checks to see if he holds onto his sword and shield, making two opposed Strength rolls. He loses the shield, but keeps hold of his sword. Now the DM checks to see if Lodestone resists the drag on his armor. At 30 feet, the magnetism has a Strength of 18. Lodestone rolls a 6, but the magnetism roll is a 12. Even though both Lodestone and the magnetism made their Strength rolls, the magnetism roll is higher than Lodestone’s roll and does not go over its target Strength score. As a result, Lodestone is dragged 6 feet closer to it. Next round, Lodestone tries again and blows his roll altogether, moving a full 10 feet closer. Now only 14 feet from the boulder, the magnetism’s Strength is effectively a 20, which means Lodestone is in big trouble. If he blows his roll again the next round, he’ll go flying into the boulder at a rate of 20 feet/round, which will inflict 2d6 points of damage. If a creature wins its Strength check, it can ignore the spell’s effects and move out of the zone of influence normally. Sirellyn’s superior magnetism also affects the passage of iron or steel missiles, such as steel-headed arrows or quarrels. Any missile that passes through the zone of influence suffers an attack penalty equal to the movement at the range indicated. For example, if the path of an arrow brings it within 40 feet of a magnetized object, the attack suffers a –5 penalty. Finally, it is possible for the casting wizard to be affected by this spell as well. As a result, the wizard had better make sure that he’s out of the effective area of effect when casting. The material component for this spell is a small bar magnet, bent into a U-shape and coated with mithral."

    "Description": "This powerful spell imbues the caster with the physical fortitude and resilience of a troll. While the spell is in effect, the caster regenerates 3 hit points per round until he reaches his normal maximum. He also gains a troll’s ability to ignore dismemberment, decapitation, and other horrible injuries that would normally incapacitate or kill him outright (although losing a limb may prevent the caster from taking certain actions, such as running, climbing, and other activities). Bleeding, wounding, being reduced to negative hit points, and other effects that cause the victim to lose hit points from round to round are ignored—the caster instead regains 3 hit points per round, up to his normal maximum. If the caster is reduced to less than 0 hit points, he is incapacitated and must make a system shock roll or lose all of his highest level spells. The incapacitation lasts only until his regeneration restores him to 1 hit point or more; he can move, fight, and cast spells again as soon as his hit point total is positive. Trollish fortitude does not provide the caster with any defenses against lethal poison, disease, and other effects that don’t cause a loss of hit points. Hit points lost through level draining, vampiric touch, or vampiric regeneration cannot be regenerated since this represents damage to the victim’s life force, and not physical injury. In addition, fire damage and acid damage cannot be regenerated. While the spell is in effect, the caster can rejoin severed limbs simply by holding them in place, but if the spell ends while a limb (which were already moving toward him) is still separate from his body, he immediately suffers the full effects of the injury. The material component for this spell is a shred of dried flesh from a troll’s heart that must be pulverized into dust. The dust is then sprinkled on the caster."

    "Description": "A banishment spell enables the caster to force some extraplanar creature out of the caster's home plane. The effect is instantaneous, and the subject cannot come back without some special summoning or means of egress from its own plane to the one from which it was banished. Up to 2 Hit Dice or levels of creature per caster level can be banished. The caster must both name the type of creature(s) to be sent away and give its nameand title as well, if any. In any event, the creature's magic resistance must be overcome for the spell to be effective. The material components of the spell are substances harmful, hateful, or opposed to the nature of the subject(s) of the spell. For every such substance included in the casting, the subject creature(s) loses 5% from its magic resistance and suffers a -2 penalty to its saving throw vs. spell. For example, if iron, holy water, sunstone, and a sprig of rosemary were used in casting a banishment upon a being that hates those things, its saving throw versus the spell would be made with a -8 penalty (four substances times the factor of -2). Special items, such as hair from the tail of a ki-rin or couatl feathers, could also be added to change the factor to -3 or -4 per item. In contrast, a titan's hair or mistletoe blessed by a druid might lower the factor to -1 with respect to the same creature. If the subject creature successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell, the caster is stung by a backlash of energy, suffers 2d6 points of damage, and is stunned for one round."

The hand itself inflicts no damage. The grasping hand has an Armor Class of 0, has as many hit points as its caster in full health, and vanishes when destroyed.

Those undead nearest to this point are affected, until either undead equal in Hit Dice to the caster's level or six undead are affected. Undead with 3 Hit Dice or less are automatically controlled. Those of greater Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. spell, which, if successful, negates the attempt to control that creature. Regardless of the success or failure of the saving throw, each creature required to make a check counts toward the Hit Dice limit of the spell. Those creatures under the control of the wizard can be commanded by the caster if they are within hearing range. There is no telepathic communication or language requirement between the caster and the controlled undead. Even if communication is impossible, the controlled undead do not attack the spellcaster.

    "Description": "When this spell is cast, the wizard teleports some desired item from virtually any location directly to his hand. The single object can be no longer in any dimension than a sword, can have no more weight than a shield (about eight pounds), and must be nonliving. To prepare this spell, the wizard must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 gp value in his hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. At some point in the future, he must crush the gem and utter the final word. The desired item is then transported instantly into the spellcaster's right or left hand, as he desires. The item must have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named; only that particular item is summoned by the spell. During the initial incantation, the gem becomes magically inscribed with the name of the item to be summoned. The inscription is invisible and unreadable, except by means of a read magic spell, to all but the wizard who cast the summons. If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, and the caster knows who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence, but only if such items are not in the possession (not necessarily the physical grasp) of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th, the wizard is able to summon a desired item from one plane farther removed from the plane he is in at the time the spell is cast (one plane away at 14th level, two planes away at 15th, etc.). Thus, a wizard of 16th level could cast the spell even if the desired item was on the second layer of one of the Outer Planes, but at 14th level the wizard would be able to summon the item only if it were no farther than one of the Inner Planes, the Ethereal Plane, or the Astral Plane (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). Note that special wards or barriers, or factors that block the teleport or plane shift spells, may also block the operation of this spell. Objects in Leomund's secret chest cannot be recovered by using this spell. Note: If the item is wizard marked, it can be summoned from anywhere on the same plane unless special local conditions apply. Furthermore, the details of the location of the item are more specific, and the item is more easily traceable with other types of scrying magic."

    "Description": "A duo-dimension spell causes the caster to have only two dimensions, height and width, with no depth. He is thus invisible when turned sideways. This invisibility can be detected only by means of a true seeing spell or similar methods. In addition, the duo- dimensional wizard can pass through the thinnest of spaces as long as these have the proper height--going through the space between a door and its frame is a simple matter. The wizard can perform all actions normally. He can turn and become invisible, move in this state, and appear again next round and cast a spell, disappearing on the followinground. Note that when turned, the wizard cannot be affected by any form of attack, but when visible, he is subject to double the amount of damage normal for an attack form; for example, a dagger thrust would inflict 2d4 points of damage if it struck a duo- dimensional wizard. Furthermore, the wizard has a portion of his existence in the Astral Plane when the spell is in effect, and he is subject to possible notice by creatures there. If noticed, it is 25% probable that the wizard is pulled entirely into the Astral Plane by any attack from an astral creature. Such an attack (and any subsequent attack received on the Astral Plane) inflicts normal damage. The material components of this spell are a flat ivory likeness of the spellcaster (which must be of finest workmanship, gold filigreed, and enameled and gem-studded at an average cost of 500 to 1,000 gp) and a strip of parchment. As the spell is uttered, the parchment is given half a twist and joined at the ends. The figurine is then passed through the parchment loop, and both disappear forever."

The changes can be reversed before animation by a limited wish or similar spell cast directly upon the body, and a full wish restores the subject to life. The caster utters the finger of death spell incantation, points his index finger at the creature to be slain, and unless the victim succeeds in a saving throw vs. spell, death occurs. A creature successfully saving still receives 2d8+1 points of damage. If the subject dies of damage, no internal changes occur and the victim can then be revived normally."

    "Description": "This powerful spell enables the caster to bring into being a cube of force, but it is unlike the magical item of that name in one important respect: The forcecage does not have solid walls of force; it has alternating bands of force with _-inch gaps between. Thus, it is truly a cage, rather than an enclosed space with solid walls. Creatures withinthe area of effect of the spell are caught and contained unless they are able to pass through the openings--and, of course, all spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars of force of the forcecage. A creature with magic resistance has a single attempt to pass through the walls of the cage. If the resistance check is successful, the creature escapes. If it fails, the creature is caged. Note that a successful check does not destroy the cage, nor does it enable other creatures (save familiars) to flee with the escaping creature. The forcecage is also unlike the solid-walled protective device, cube of force, in that it can be gotten rid of only by means of a dispel magic spell or by the expiration of the spell. By means of special preparation at the time of memorization, a forcecage spell can be altered to a forcecube spell. The cube created is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then resembles that of a cube of force in all respects save that of the differences between a cast spell and the magic of a device, including the methods of defeating its power. Although the actual casting of either application of the spell requires no material component, the study required to commit it to memory does demand that the wizard powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp value, using the diamond dust to trace the outlines of the cage or cube he desires to create via spellcasting at some later time. Thus, in memorization, the diamond dust is employed and expended, for upon completion of study, the wizard must then toss the dust into the air and it will disappear."

Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of a limited wish will not substantially change major realities, nor will it bring wealth or experience merely by asking. The spell can, for example, restore some hit points (or all hit points for a limited duration) lost by the wizard. It can reduce opponent hit probabilities or damage, increase duration of some magical effect, cause a creature to be favorably disposed to the spellcaster, mimic a spell of 7th level or less, and so on (see the 9th-level wish spell). Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. Casting time is based on the time spent preparing the wording for the spell (clever players decide what they want to say before using the spell). Normally, the casting time is one round (most of it being taken up by deciding what to say). Casting this spell ages the caster one year per 100 years of regular life span."

The caster of the spell controls entry to the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind him when he enters. He may open it again from his own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they behold a magnificent foyer and numerous chambers beyond. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to as many dozens of people as the spellcaster has levels of experience. There is a staff of near-transparent servants, liveried and obedient, to wait upon all who enter. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. Rest and relaxation within the place is normal, but the food is not. It seems excellent and quite filling as long as one is within the place. Once outside, however, its effects disappear immediately, and if those resting have not eaten real food within a reasonable time span, ravenous hunger strikes. Failure to eat normal food immediately results in the onset of fatigue or starvation penalties as decided by the DM. The material components of this spell are a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon. These are utterly destroyed when the spell is cast. (It is worth mentioning that this spell has been used in conjunction with a normal portal, as well as with illusion magic.

For example, if cast by a 14th-level wizard, the weapon has the same hit probability as a sword wielded by a 7th- level fighter. The sword has no magical attack bonuses, but it can hit nearly any sort of opponent, even those normally struck only by +3 weapons or those who are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. It hits any Armor Class on a roll of 19 or 20. It inflicts 5d4 points of damage to opponents of man size or smaller, and 5d6 points of damage to opponents larger than man size.

If the caster desires, one other creature of man size or less can be taken through the door; this counts as two uses of the door. The door does not pass light, sound, or spell effects, nor can the caster see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A gem of true seeing and similar magic will reveal the presence of a phase door but will not allow its use. The phase door lasts for one usage for every two levels of experience of the spellcaster. It can be dispelled only by a casting of dispel magic from a higher-level wizard, or from several lower-level wizards, casting in concert, whose combined levels of experience are more than double that of the wizard who cast the spell (this is the only instance in which dispel effects can be combined). Rumor has it that this spell has been adapted by a certain powerful wizard (or wizards) to create renewable (or permanent) portals, which may (or may not) be keyed to specific individuals (henchmen) or items (such as rings)."

In this region, the wizard can move at a rate of up to 7 miles per turn, moving normally on the borders of the Demiplane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Prime Material Plane. Thus, a wizard can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Demiplane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Prime Material Plane. The wizard knows where he will come out on the Prime Material Plane. The shadow walk spell can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Demiplane of Shadow, but this requires the potentially perilous transit of the Demiplane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. Any creatures touched by the wizard when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Demiplane of Shadow. They may opt to follow the wizard, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Prime Material Plane (50% chance for either result if they are lost or abandoned by the wizard). Creatures unwilling to accompany the wizard into the Demiplane of Shadow receive a saving throw, negating the effect if successful."

At all times the simulacrum remains under the absolute command of the wizard who created it. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. The spell creates the form of the creature, but it is only a zombielike creation. A reincarnation spell must be used to give the duplicate a vital force, and a limited wish spell must be used to empower the duplicate with 40% to 65% (35% + 5 to 30%) of the knowledge and personality of the original. The level of the simulacrum, if any, is from 20% to 50% of that of the original creature. The duplicate creature is formed from ice or snow. The spell is cast over the rough form and some piece of the creature to be duplicated must be placed inside the snow or ice. Additionally, the spell requires powdered ruby. The simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful; it cannot increase its level or abilities. If destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts into nothingness. Damage to the simulacrum can be repaired by a complex process requiring at least one day, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped laboratory."

This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but specifically excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, etc. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area within which the protected wizard is standing. From seven to ten spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows for certain how effective the spell is. A spell may be only partially turned--divide the number of remaining levels that can be turned by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect is turned, with the remainder affecting the caster. For example, an incoming fireball is centered on a wizard with one level of spell turning left. This means that 2/3 of the fireball affects the protected wizard, 1/3 affects the caster, and each is the center of a fireball effect. If the rolled damage is 40 points, the protected wizard receives 27 points of damage and the caster suffers 13. Both (and any creatures in the respective areas) can roll saving throws vs. spell for half damage. A partially turned hold or paralysis spell will act as a slow spell on those who are 50% or more affected. If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects: D100 Roll Effect 01-70 Spell drains away without effect 71-80 Spell affects both equally at full damage81-97 Both turning effects are rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 turns 98-00 Both casters go through a rift into the Positive Energy plane The material component for the spell is a small silver mirror."

    "Description": "When a statue spell is cast, the wizard or other creature is apparently turned to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires one full round after the spell is cast. During the transformation, there's an 18% chance that the targeted creature suffers a system shock failure and dies. The creature must roll percentile dice and add its Constitution score to the roll. If the total is 18 or less, the creature dies. If the total is 19 or more, the creature survives the transformation; the creature can withstand any inspection and appear to be a stone statue, although faint magic is detected from the stone if someone checks for it. Note that a creature with a Constitution of 18 or more will always survive the transformation. Despite being in this condition, the petrified individual can see, hear, and smell normally. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body--i.e., chipping is equal to a slight wound, but breaking off one of the statue's arms is serious damage. The individual under the magic of a statue spell can return to his normal state instantly, act, and then return to the statue state, if he so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect. The material components of this spell are lime, sand, and a drop of water stirred by an iron bar, such as a nail or spike."

The maximum volume of material that can be affected is 3 cubic feet per level of experience. Thus, both weight and volume limit the spell. An object that exceeds either limitation is unaffected and the spell fails. If desired, a vanished object can be placed deep within the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object vanished remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful dispel magic spell cast on the point will bring the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane. Note that creatures and magical forces cannot be made to vanish. There is a 1% chance that a vanished item will be disintegrated instead. There is also a 1% chance that a creature from the Ethereal Plane is able to gain access to the Prime Material Plane through the vanished item's connection."

The material component of the spell is the sacrifice of something valued by the spellcaster or by the power supplicated. The more precious the sacrifice, the better the chance of spell success.

If the undead creature has intelligence, it is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to resist the joining. If the save is successful, the caster's spirit is forced back into his own body. The wizard must make a system shock roll; if the roll fails, the wizard suffers 5d6 points of damage. If the roll succeeds, the wizard suffers half this damage. If the creature's save fails, the necromancer joins his life essence with that of the undead. While in the creature's body, the caster can use all of its special attacks and innate abilities, excluding spells memorized by the creature. The wizard's body remains comatose, is subject to all regular attacks, and suffers damage normally. The wizard's spirit can travel an unlimited distance from his physical body as long as they remain on the same plane of existence. If intelligent, the possessed undead continually tries to purge the caster with mental threats that can be heard only by the wizard. The thoughts of the undead are ghastly. During the first minute of each hour of possession, the caster must succeed an Intelligence check in order to retain his sanity. The roll is modified by the difference between the creature's Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the undead has a higher score, the difference is added to the die roll. If the necromancer has a higher Intelligence, the difference is subtracted from the roll. If the roll is successful, nothing happens and the caster may continue to possess the undead. If the Intelligence roll fails, the wizard's intellect degenerates, making him a raving, homicidal maniac. His spirit is immediately forced to return to his body, and he must attempt a system shock roll with damage occurring as outlined above. The caster remains dangerously insane until a heal or wish spell is used to restore his intellect. This spell can be very useful when combined with the mask of death spell. When the spell's duration expires, the necromancer's spirit immediately returns to his body."

While it is in effect, the spell gives no visible sign of its existence. It offers no protection against area effect spells. If a wild mage is the target of a spell or magical item, this spell automatically allows him a saving throw. If the saving throw is failed, the opponent's spell has normal effects.

The wild mage can then choose to let the energy dissipate or he can instantly use it to cast a spell back at the opposing mage. The return spell must be of an equal or lesser spell level than the original one and must be currently memorized by the mage. The act of returning the spell does not cost the wild mage any of his memorized spells. Spell energy cannot be saved; if not used immediately, it dissipates. For example, Hamos, a wild mage, is protected by a spell shape and is struck by a finger of death (a 7th-level spell). He succeeds at his saving throw and is now able to cast a spell of 7th level or lower. Hamos currently has feeblemind memorized. Since it is only a 5th-level spell, he chooses to cast it back at his enemy. He makes his level variation check (and doesn't get a wild surge) and the feeblemind is sent hurtling back at his foe. Hamos still has his original feeblemind memorized. The remaining two spell levels are lost, since they were not used in the same round. If a wild mage is struck by two spells at once, he may choose which spell to shape. He suffers all effects of the remaining spell. The material component is a diamond worth no less than 2,000 gp.

At the culmination of the spell, the original magical object is allowed an item saving throw vs. disintegration with all modifiers it is allowed as a magical item. Exceptionally powerful objects (such as artifacts) may be considered to automatically succeed the saving throw at the DM's discretion. If the saving throw is successful, the magical object resists the effect and the spell ends in failure. If the roll is failed, the magical item loses all of its powers, which are transferred to the previously nonmagical object. Even if the magical item fails its saving throw, the spell's success is not guaranteed. There is a chance that the enchantment might be lost. The base chance of this occurring is 100%, modified by -5% per level of the caster. Thus, a 20th-level wizard has no chance of losing the magic. If the enchantment is lost, both items become nonmagical. The material component is the nonmagical item which is to receive the enchantment. It must be of equal or greater value than the object to be drained."

    "CastingTime": "2 rounds",

    "Description": "This spell is similar to the 4th-level wizard spell empathic wound transfer, except that it enables the caster to transfer the wounds (up to 3 hp per level of the caster) between any two creatures, excluding the caster. The wizard must be able to grasp both the creature with the disability and the creature about to receive the disability without having to make attack rolls. Thus, the two beings must either be willing to undergo the spell, or else be sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise bound and secured from escaping the caster's grasp. The recipient of the disability is entitled to a saving throw vs. spells if unwilling. If the recipient's saving throw succeeds, the transfer is incomplete and nothing further happens. If failed, the recipient gains the wounds of the disabled creature, subject to a few limitations. The total amount of transferred hit points is limited to the caster's current hit points (or 3 hp per level, whichever is smaller). Normally, the spell functions by conveying the wounds from the disabled creature to the caster (during the first round of casting) and then from the caster to the final recipient (during the second round of the spell). Should an conferred disability drain the wizard below zero hit points (if the wizard unwittingly attempts to channel more hit points than he or she currently possesses), the exchange effectively backfires and now operates on the wizard himself as an empathic wound transfer. The spell also backfires if it is interrupted during the second round of casting, before the final conferral of life force to the recipient. At the DM's discretion, this spell will never backfire when employed by a necromancer, who is presumably an expert in these rites. If interrupted during casting, the spell merely fails without any transfer of wounds from the disabled creature. When cast by a necromancer, this spell can also immediately restore an incapacitated and unconscious creature, as per the 3rd-level priest spell death's door. This spell is terribly exhausting for the caster. After the exchange is complete, the wizard temporarily loses seven points of Constitution; each point may be recovered by two hours of complete rest. If the caser's Constitution drops below 3, unconsciousness results, and the full Constitution is not regained for 24 hours. The material components are the same as for as the empathic wound transfer spell, except for a specially fashioned ruby brooch or pendant (worth at least 5,000 gp) which must be worn by the wizard at the time of casting. The ruby, which serves as a temporary receptacle or buffer for the exchanged life force, shatters upon the completion of the spell."

    "Description": "More insidious and powerful than the feeblemind spell, descent into madness afflicts one creature with a random form of insanity. The spell can affect any creature with an Intelligence of low (5) or higher; however, a character or creature protected by a mind blank is immune to this spell. Creatures are entitled to a normal saving throw vs. spell to withstand the spell. The form of insanity caused by the spell is determined by a roll on the chart: d% Insanity Type 01–15 Delirium 16–22 Disorientation 23–34 Phobia 35–40 Paranoia 41–44 Alienation 45–54 Amnesia 55–64 Hallucinatory insanity 65–69 Melancholia 70–74 Dementia praecox 75–83 Mania 84–89 Hebephrenia 90–95 Catatonia 96–00 Homicidal mania The various types of insanity and their game effects are described under the Alienist in Chapter 6. The caster has no idea what kind of madness the spell inflicts on its victim, although he may be able to form an educated guess after observing the victim for a few rounds. Descent into madness accelerates the process of insanity radically, producing an advanced condition almost immediately; for example, a character rendered paranoid by this spell skips past suspicion and instantly regards his friends and allies as enemies of the worst sort. The victim has a small chance of recovering with the passage of time (as described under each type of insanity) but other than that the only ways to repair the effects of this spell are restoration, wish, or use of the psionic power psychic surgery. The material component is a special cube of gold wire worth at least 500 gold pieces shaped to represent a tesseract, or four-dimensional figure."

Harmful gas or vapor is transformed into a common, harmless fog cloud of the same dimensions as the original effect, and then dissipates 1d3 rounds later. Creatures who were injured before neutralize gas is cast continue to suffer any effects from their previous exposure—the spell does not heal or counter existing damage, so a creature that is choking and gagging from a stinking cloud would receive no relief from this dweomer. If cast in the same round of the effect’s appearance, neutralize gas may be used to counter gaseous breath weapons, spores, and molds by granting any creatures affected a +4 bonus to their saving throws and reducing any damage to one-half or one-quarter normal, depending on whether or not the victims make their saving throws. Air-based creatures are not affected by this spell; neutralize gas only “clears the air” of any harmful inhalants. The material components are a bit of charcoal and some bark from a treant."

    "Duration": "1 day/level",
    "Description": "Related to both the contingency and permanency spells, persistence allows a wizard to cast a spell of 6th level or lower and then hold it until it is needed. There are two general uses for persistence: to use a personal spell effect as needed up to the maximum duration of the persistence itself, or to prepare an instantaneous spell and hold it ready until the caster wishes to use it. A. Personal effect. Any spell that augments the wizard’s natural abilities—detect magic, protection from evil, jump, infravision, fly, wraithform, or other caster-affecting spells—can be made persistent by use of this spell. The wizard casts persistence and then immediately follows with the desired spell. Instead of taking effect immediately, the magic of the persistence holds it ready for use by a simple act of will. The wizard can then “turn on” or “turn off” the girded spell as often as he likes over the course of the duration of the persistence. The duration of the girded spell only runs while the spell is active, so a 15th-level wizard who makes a fly spell persistent will be able to use 1d6+15 turns of flight (the normal duration of fly) over the next 15 days (the duration of the persistence) as he sees fit. This is especially useful because it allows the wizard to cast the girded spell and the persistence and have the girded spell’s effects available while he then memorizes another spell in place of the spell made persistent. It is also useful because the girded spell can be activated instantly by an act of will. The main difference between this spell and contingency lies in the fact that a persistent spell may be invoked several times (up to the limit of its normal duration) while a contingency functions once only. B. Held spell. Spells that have an instantaneous effect, such as most attack spells and some movement spells like teleport or dimension door, can be rendered persistent as well. The held spell may be activated or discharged at any time during the duration of the persistence, but its magic is then exhausted as if it had been cast normally. This resembles the effect of a contingency spell, but the effect has no predefined conditions and simply occurs when the caster wills it to. Damaging or offensive spells that have a duration (for example, flaming sphere or wall of fire) cannot be rendered persistent. A wizard may have no more than one persistence spell active at any given time; if he girds a new spell while an old one is still persistent, the old spell is simply replaced by the new one. The material component is a crystal chalice of exquisite workmanship worth at least 2,000 gp. The material component of a held or girded spell is expended when the spell is made persistent."

    "Description": "This spell conjures into existence seven magical orbs that float above the caster’s head in a ring about 5 feet in diameter. The eyes remain for 1 round per level, or until the caster chooses to either expend the orb by using it in attack or defense. In addition, as long as at least one eye is still in existence, the caster gains 360° vision and can detect invisibility and detect phase at will, with a 60-foot range. The powers of each eye are described below. Eye of the Mind. This orb protects the caster against mental attack, charm, or influence, including charm, beguiling, hold, and emotion effects. The first such attack is negated by the orb and destroys it in turn. If the wizard desires, the eye of the mind can instead be used to charm person like the 1st-level wizard spell, although this also expends the orb. Eye of the Sword. This eye deflects the first physical attack that endangers the caster, including hand-held or missile attacks, and then disappears. The wizard can also employ the eye of the sword to create five magical blades that strike as magic missiles for 1d4+1 points of damage each. (Knockdown d6, medium (1 hit) impact) Eye of the Mage. One manifestation of raw energy, such as lightning, fire, force, cold, or a similar effect, is absorbed by the eye of the mage. The eye can also project a 60-foot long by 5-foot wide lightning bolt that inflicts 4d8 damage (saving throw vs. spell for half damage) to all in its path. Either use expends the eye’s power. (Knockdown d12, large (1–3 hits) electricity) Eye of Venom. This eye can be used to halt any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. In the case of an attacker armed with an envenomed weapon, the caster may decide to expend either the eye of venom or the eye of swords in order to block the attack. The eye can also be used to poison one creature within 30 feet; the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in one round. Eye of the Spirit. The first attack that affects the victim’s life energy, including energy drain, strength drain, cause wounds, trap the soul, magic jar, or death is parried by the eye of the spirit. The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye’s power by casting enervation (see the 4th-level wizard spell) upon one target within 30 feet. Eye of Artifice. This eye deflects and is destroyed by the first attack directed at the caster from a magical device. If the attack also takes a form that may be blocked by another eye (for example, the bolt from a wand of lightning) the caster may choose which eye is expended. If used to attack instead, the eye of artifice functions as a dispel magic cast at 8th level. Eye of Stone. This eye offers protection against the first attack that could petrify the caster and then vanishes. It can also be expended to cast hold person. Although any number of eyes can defend the wizard in the course of a single round, only one eye may be used to attack per round. When the caster uses an eye to attack, he may not cast a spell, attack physically, or employ another magical item in the same round; willing the eye to discharge its energies requires his complete concentration. Eye attacks are considered to have an initiative modifier of 1 or a speed of very fast in the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system. The material component is seven blessed gemstones worth at least 50 gold pieces each."

The wizard must decide which effect is desired with regard to what creature type or alignment before beginning the spellcasting, for the components of each application differ. The spell cannot be cast upon living creatures. Antipathy: This spell causes the affected creature or alignment type to feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to not touch the affected item. If a saving throw vs. spell is successful, the creature can stay in the area or touch the item, but the creature will feel very uncomfortable, and a persistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss of 1 point of Dexterity per round (for the spell's duration), subject to a maximum loss of 4 points and a minimum Dexterity of 3. Failure to save vs. spell forces the being to abandon the area or item, shunning it permanently and never willingly returning to it until the spell is removed or expires. The material component for this application of the spell is a lump of alum soaked in vinegar. Sympathy: By casting the sympathy application of the spell, the wizard can cause a particular type of creature or alignment of character to feel elated and pleased to be in an area or touching or possessing an object or item. The desire to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. Unless a saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled, the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the object. If the saving throw is successful, the creature or character is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent saving throw must be made 1d6 turns later. If this saving throw fails, the affected creature will return to the area or object. The material components of this spell are 1,000 gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop of honey. Note that the particular type of creature to be affected must be named specifically--for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, catoblepas, vampires, etc. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named--for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, etc. If this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot cube can be enchanted for each experience level of the caster. If an object or item is enchanted, only that single thing can be enchanted; affected creatures or characters save vs. spell with a -2 penalty."

    "Description": "A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature, usually from another plane of existence. Extraplanar creatures must be confined by a circular diagram; other creatures can be physically confined. The duration of the spell depends upon the form of the binding and the level of the caster(s), as well as the length of time the spell is actually uttered. The components vary according to the form of the spell, but they include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or book page giving the spell; gestures appropriate to the form of binding; and materials such as miniature chains of special metal (silver for lycanthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest sort, a corundum or diamond gem of great size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of the subject creature), and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured. Magic resistance applies unless the subject's true name is used. A saving throw is not applicable as long as the experience level of the caster is at least twice as great as the Hit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can be augmented by one-third of the levels of each assisting wizard of 9th level or higher, and by one level for each assistant of 4th through8th level. No more than six other wizards can assist with this spell. If the caster's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the subject, the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell, modified by the form of binding being attempted. The various forms of binding are: Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except the caster. Duration is as long as one year per level of the caster(s). The subject of this form of binding (as well as in the slumber and bound slumber versions) remains within the restraining barrier. Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon the subject for a duration of up to one year per level of the caster(s). Bound Slumber: A combination of chaining and slumber that lasts for up to one month per level of the caster(s). Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means until freed. The spell remains until the magical hedge is somehow broken. Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to change to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject. Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunken to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within the hedged prison of some gem or similar object. The subject of a minimus containment, metamorphosis, or hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of magic. The subject of the chaining form of the spell receives a saving throw with no modifications. However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged prison a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and minimus containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the subject is magically weakened, the DM can assign a -1, -2, or even -4 penalty to the saving throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases. A binding spell can be renewed in the case of the first three forms of the spell, for the subject does not have the opportunity to break the bonds. (If anything has caused a weakening of a chaining or slumber version, such as attempts to contact the subject or magically touch it, a normal saving throw applies to the renewal of the spell.) Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the subject gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the binding spell is broken and the creature is free."

If one cannot destroy the other, one will go insane and destroy itself (90% likely to be the clone), or possibly both will become mad and destroy themselves(2% chance). These events nearly always occur within one week of the dual existence. Note that the clone is the person as he existed at the time at which the flesh was taken for the spell component, and all subsequent knowledge, experience, etc., is totally unknown to the clone. The clone is a physical duplicate, and possessions of the original are another matter entirely. A clone takes 2d4 months to grow, and only after that time is dual existence established. Furthermore, the clone has one less Constitution point than the body it was cloned from; the cloning fails if the clone would have a Constitution of 0. The material component of the spell is a small piece of the flesh from the person to be duplicated.

Of course, if the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand comes, the message is understood but no saving throw is necessary and the suggestion is ineffective. The caster must be familiar with the creature contacted and must know its name and appearance well. If the creature in question is not in the same plane of existence as the spellcaster, there is a base 5% chance that the demand does not arrive. Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably at the option of the DM. The demand, if received, will be understood even if the creature has an Intelligence ability score as low as 1 (animal Intelligence). Creatures of demigod status or higher can choose to come or not, as they please. The demand message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the suggestion. The creature can also give a short reply immediately.

In order to cast this spell, the wizard must have an available fire source (just as with a pyrotechnics spell), scrapings from beneath a dung pile, and a pinch of dust."

Note that even if more than 5,000 pounds of weight is englobed, the perceived weight is only 1/16 of the actual weight, so the orb can be rolled without exceptional effort. Because of the reduced weight, rapid motion or falling within the field of the sphere is relatively harmless to the object therein, although it can be disastrous should the globe disappear when the subject inside is high above a hard surface. The caster can dismiss the effect with a word.

The personal spells upon which a permanency is known to be effective are as follows: comprehend languages protection from evil detect evil protection from normal missiles detect invisibility read magic detect magic tongues infravision unseen servant protection from cantrips The wizard casts the desired spell and then follows it with the permanency spell. Each permanency spell lowers the wizard's Constitution by 1 point. The wizard cannot cast these spells upon other creatures. This application of permanency can be dispelled only by a wizard of greater level than the spellcaster was when he cast the spell. In addition to personal use, the permanency spell can be used to make the following object/creature or area-effect spells permanent: enlarge prismatic sphere fear stinking cloud gust of wind wall of fire invisibility wall of force magic mouth web Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and rendered permanent: alarm wall of fire audible glamer distance distortion dancing lights teleport solid fog These applications to other spells allow it to be cast simultaneously with any of the latter when no living creature is the target, but the entire spell complex then can be dispelled normally, and thus negated. The permanency spell is also used in the fabrication of magical items (see the 6th-level spell enchant an item). At the DM's option, permanency might become unstable or failafter a long period of at least 1,000 years. Unstable effects might operate intermittently or fail altogether. The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell. If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research automatically fails. Note that the wizard never learns what is possible except by the success or failure of his research."

    "Duration": "Variable",
    "Description": "This spell changes one object or creature into another. When used as a polymorph other or stone to flesh spell, simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws made with -4 penalties to the die roll. When it is cast in order to change other objects, the duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state, as well as how different it is in size. The DM determines the changes by using the following guidelines: Kingdom Animal, vegetable, mineral Class Mammals, bipeds, fungi, metals, etc. Relationship Twig is to tree, sand is to beach, etc. Size Smaller, equal, larger Shape Comparative resemblance of the original to the polymorphed state Intelligence Particularly with regard to a change in which the end product is more intelligent A change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours (if removed by one kingdom) or turns (if removed by two). Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change with a duration measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an elephant would be permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with a duration of several turns. All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh spell or its reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed; perhaps the wizard could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the new form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicatemany of these situations. The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding the polymorph other and stone to flesh spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item's or creature's powers, but does not add new powers, except possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise, valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items. The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke."

The duration of the spell depends upon how many hit points are affected. If 25 or fewer hit points are affected, the blindness is permanent until cured. If 26 to 50 hit points are affected, the blindness lasts for 1d4+1 turns. If 51 to 100 hit points are affected, the spell lasts for 1d4+1 rounds. An individual creature cannot be partially affected.

    "Description": "This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation. When the spell is cast, the wizard dictates what will and will not be observed in the area of effect. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Thus, the caster could specify the illusion of him and another playing chess for the duration of the spell, but he could not have the illusionary chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game. He could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. He could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that his troops be undetected, or even that every fifth man or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by the caster with no saving throw allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. A band of men standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, etc. Direct observation may allow a saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if the column of a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another! Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a saving throw, assuming the hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion."

    "Description": "By means of this spell, a wizard can force a creature or object into the very earth or floor upon which it stands. When casting the spell, the wizard must chant the spell for the remainder of the round without interruption. At that juncture, the subject creature or object becomes rooted to the spot unless a saving throw vs. spell (for a creature) or disintegration (for an object with magical properties) is successful. (Note: \"magical properties\" include those of magical items as listed in the Dungeon Master Guide, those of items enchanted or otherwise of magical origin, and those of items with protection- type spells or with permanent magical properties or similar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical nature are not entitled to a saving throw. If a subject fails its saving throw, itbecomes of slightly greater density than the surface upon which it stands. The spellcaster now has the option of ceasing his spell and leaving the subject as it is, in which case the spell expires in four turns, and the subject returns to normal. If the caster proceeds with the spell (into the next round), the subject begins to sink slowly into the ground. Before any actions are taken in the new round, the subject sinks one-quarter of its height; after the first group acts, another quarter; after the second group acts, another; and at the end of the round, the victim is totally sunken into the ground. This entombment places a creature or object in a state of suspended animation. The cessation of time means that the subject does not grow older. Bodily and other functions virtually cease, but the subject is otherwise unharmed. The subject exists in undamaged form in the surface into which it was sunk, its upper point as far beneath the surface as the subject has height--a 6-foot-tall victim will be 6 feet beneath the surface, while a 60- foot-tall subject will have its uppermost point 60 feet below ground level. If the ground around the subject is somehow removed, the spell is broken and the subject returns to normal, but it does not rise up. Spells such as dig, transmute rock to mud, and freedom (the reverse of the 9th-level spell imprisonment) will not harm the sunken creature or object and will often be helpful in recovering it. If a detect magic spell is cast over an area upon which a sink spell was used, it reveals a faint magical aura of undefinable nature, even if the subject is beyond detection range. If the subject is within range of the detection, the spell's schools can be discovered (alteration and enchantment)."

    "Description": "This spell forces the creature's life force (and its material body) into a special prison gem enchanted by the spellcaster. The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered. The spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature's real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters. The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magicresistance or saving throw. The gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. Before the actual casting of the trap the soul spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is a tempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an enchant an item spell and the placement of a maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force."

This creature is invisible to all but the caster and appears as a miniature version of the caster perched atop the wizard's head. The wizard may move and act normally while this spell is in effect. The magical homunculus operates as an independent spellcaster. It may cast only teleport, contingency, and protective spells of 4th level and lower. It casts only spells from the wizard's memorized store of spells, but any spells cast by the homunculus are done so with a casting time of 1. The wizard selects which spells are cast by his homunculus; after they are cast, they are wiped from the caster's memory. The homunculus has 1 hit point per two levels of the caster. These points are \"borrowed\" from the caster; while the homunculus is present, the wizard's hit points are reduced by this amount. The homunculus cannot be struck by melee or missile weapons separately from the wizard. It can be damaged separately from the wizard (e.g., by a magic missile targeted at the homunculus or by area effect spells). The homunculus has the attributes and saving throws of the wizard. At the end of the spell's duration, the homunculus disappears and any hit points it had are restored to the wizard. Hit points lost by the homunculus can be regained only by magical healing. If the wizard's hit points are reduced to zero at any time during the spell, the wizard is dead even if the homunculus had hit points remaining. A wizard with an active homunculus shield suffers a -4 saving throw penalty against magic jar spells cast upon him due to the division of his mental energy. The material component is a miniature sculpted bust of the spellcaster."

All of the caster's weapons and equipment stay with him, but he is unable to use them while in shadow form. He is also unable to cast spells while in shadow form, but he is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells, and is unaffected by cold-based attacks. He is 90 percent undetectable in all but the brightest of surroundings. Unlike normal shadows, a wizard in shadow form cannot be turned by priests.

Any spell cast in the area of effect is automatically treated as a wild surge (see Table 2). Effects from magical items that expend charges are also treated as wild surges when used in the area.

    "Description": "Death shroud draws upon the Negative Material Plane to surround the caster in a dark and shadowy aura of life-draining energy. While the spellcaster suffers no ill-effects from this baneful radiance, it may have dire consequences for anyone who comes into contact with the aura. The death shroud can be used actively in offense and passively in defense. In combat, the wizard may activate the deadly power of the spell by touching a victim (requiring a successful attack roll). Any creature touched must immediately save vs. death magic with a -4 penalty. If the roll is successful, the victim is unharmed. If the save is failed, a black haze forms around the victim, draining 20% of his or her current hit points each round until the unfortunate individual dies at the end of the fifth round. The death shroud also serves as a passive ward or protection for the caster. Anyone who touches the wizard or attempts to strike him or her with any handheld object or melee weapon must make a saving throw vs. death magic (with no penalties) or be stricken by the death shroud in a similar manner. The following spells remove the death shroud from an afflicted individual: cure critical wounds, heal, limited wish, wish, or a successful dispel magic. Lesser curing spells and healing potions delay death only by one round. Multiple applications of these spells or potions may prolong a victim's life until the duration of the spell expires. The spell may also be ended prematurely by killing or successfully employing dispel magic on the caster (this immediately releases all creatures afflicted by the spell). The death shroud remains in effect until the wizard has successfully attacked or been attacked by a number of creatures equal to his or her current level (or the spell's maximum duration of two rounds per level has elapsed). Undead are not affected by this spell. In fact, if an undead creature is attacked by a death shroud, it immediately gains 1 HD, and the wizard must save vs. death magic or suffer the effects of the death shroud him- or herself. This dreadful spell is known only to a select cadre of necromancers who purportedly learned it from a mysterious, bronze-bound book of extraplanar origin. The warding requires the following material components: crushed black opal and diamond (worth 5,000 gp), dust from a corporeal undead with strong ties to the Negative Material Plane (such as a vampire or wight), and a hunk of smoky quartz. These ingredients are consumed in the casting."

    "CastingTime": "Special (8 turns)",
    "Duration": "Permanent",
    "Description": "Upon completion of this long and highly-versatile incantation, the caster permanently transfers a creature's life force (even his or her own) into a specially fabricated item, a magical receptacle, or the body of another individual. Once the mental transfer has been completed, the recipient's body falls into a cataleptic state, and remains in a death-like trance or coma for 2-7 days. Unless the subject's life force is magically reunited with the body during that time period, his or her body dies, and the life force remains permanently trapped within the physical object or new body.While in the physical receptacle, the recipient may perform any action permitted by the new form. In an item such as a ring or a sword, the subject may communicate with the user when the receptacle is held or worn properly. The extent of communication depends on the subject's intelligence: Int Communication 3-11 None 12-13 Semi-Empathy 14-16 Empathy 17+ Telepathy Individuals of low or average intelligence cannot communicate, and those of above-average intelligence can communicate using a primitive form of empathy (usually limited to a throb or tingle of varying intensity). At the discretion of the DM, the life force might animate a specially prepared statue or golem, perhaps even enabling the recipient to employ any memorized spells. Life force transfer is sometimes the final step in the manufacture of a powerful magical item or minor artifact (usually a sword). In this process, a victim's life force is transferred into a magical item (unless he or she saves vs. death magic at -4), which is finally sealed with a permanency. In such an enchantment, the recipient's body is frequently destroyed afterward by the caster, forever trapping the victim's life force in the item (unless the permanency is first reversed and a new body prepared using a clone, wish, or similar means). If the item is destroyed while the recipient's life force is in it, the creature may regain its body by making a system shock roll if it lies within 1 mile per level of the original caster; otherwise, the subject's life force dissipates, and the creature dies. Sometimes, a wizard may employ this spell as a final measure to protect his or her own life. In this version, the entire incantation and receptacle are prepared and cast beforehand, but only the final syllable of the spell is left unfinished. The wizard may pronounce this short (single segment) syllable at any later time, casting his or her life force into the receptacle— providing that it lies within range. Obviously, this strategy only works if the receptacle is kept close to the wizard at all times. Furthermore, the wizard usually must leave behind clues or encrypted instructions so that his or her allies may later reverse the spell and restore the wizard to his or her normal state, whatever that may be. While the spell is in its unfinished state, the wizard cannot learn a new 8th-lcvel spell to replace it. Aside from this limitation, however, the caster remains unaffected by the pending spell. Less scrupulous wizards may use this rite to permanently transfer the recipient's life force (often their own) into the body of a younger individual, thereby extending their own existence. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. death magic with a -4 penalty to resist the effects. If failed, the subject's life force departs (resulting in the death of the victim), and the recipient's life force takes permanent possession of the victim's body. If the saving throw is successful, the spell fails without any ill effect to either the victim or recipient (though it may be recast at a later date). Thus, an ancient necromancer may transfer his or her life force into the body of a vigorous, younger person, thereby gaining all of the victim's physical attributes, manual skills, hit points, and extended life span. The spell requires either an expertly-crafted item or any living human, demihuman, or humanoid (preferably young and healthy) to house the subject's life force. The remaining material components include a scroll inscribed with special rare inks and a massive, blood red garnet (worth 5,000 gp ormore). The exact nature of any physical receptacle should be decided by the DM, but it must be of quality suitable for enchantment. The gamet (but not the scroll) is consumed in the casting. This spell cannot be dispelled normally (even in its \"pending\" state). If the receptacle was not sealed with a permanency, then the subject's life force may be driven out with spirit release or dispel evil (in the event of a permanent magical receptacle, the item's permanency must be first overcome with dispel magic). In rare cases, to be adjudicated by the DM, the life force of the victim does not depart from the body, but coexists in his or her body with that of the recipient or \"intruder.\" Such a life force may be able to take control of the survivor—use the control rules for the magic jar spell to determine this. As before, the \"intruder\" life force can only be ejected by casting spirit release or dispel evil (or a full wish). Otherwise, at the discretion of the DM, the life force of the \"intruder\" merges with that of the victim, diluting the recipient's personality, alignment, and possibly sanity, as well. The reverse of this spell, revoke life force transfer, requires the original scroll (the one used in the life force transfer spell to be revoked), the construct, and the body of the recipient. Providing that the spell is cast before the body physically dies (within 2-7 days of the original separation), the reversal process requires a system shock roll in order to be successful. If failed (or if the body has already perished), the newly released life force dissipates, and the subject dies."

    "Description": "This spell reveals to the caster all spells, enchantments, dweomers, and magical properties present in one creature or object. One property, spell, or power is revealed each round in approximate order of when the spells were cast or the properties were acquired. (If the DM doesn’t know which spells were placed on the subject first, a random roll for order of discovery is fine.) The caster has a base 50% chance to discern the existence and identity of a particular spell or property, +2% per level to a maximum of 99%. The only enchantments that remain inscrutable to analyze dweomer are those surrounding artifacts or relics. A 16th-level wizard finds an unknown wand and decides to use analyze dweomer to study it. The DM knows that it’s a wand of fire, and he decides that the spells enchant an item, fireball, burning hands, and wall of fire were used to create the wand, in that order. In the first round, the wizard has an 82% chance to identify enchant an item; in the following round, an 82% chance to discover fireball; in the next round, an 82% chance to perceive burning hands; and so on, for all remaining enchantments. Note that the DM could have decided that any rare or unusual materials or processes used to create the wand would also be revealed as if they were spells. After the wizard analyzes one object or creature, the spell ends, even if its duration has not expired yet. Casting this spell is physically taxing; the wizard must pass a system shock check or be exhausted and unable to do anything but rest for the next 1d8 hours. While this spell is most frequently used in the comfort and safety of the wizard’s laboratory, a mage could also cast analyze dweomer to study the magical seals and barriers on a portal, to determine just how a companion has been cursed, or to examine a potential opponent for defensive spells. The material component for this spell is a tiny lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop. The gemstone must be worth at least 1,000 gp."

    "Description": "This potent spell exchanges the necromancer’s own living heart for a finely crafted heart of perfect, unblemished stone that alters the very nature of the wizard’s body. As long as the heart of stone remains in effect, the caster need not fear attacks that pierce, slash, or cut him; he does not bleed and can ignore the most horrible injuries of this kind. The caster can also ignore most magical effects such as spells, magical devices, and innate spell abilities of less than 8th level. In game terms, the character suffers only 1 point of damage from any type S or type P attack, plus any magical adjustment for the weapon. For example, if struck by a long sword +1, he would suffer only 2 points of damage. Strength and specialization bonuses are ignored. If the wizard is dismembered, he suffers no additional damage other than the inconvenience of having his limbs removed, and he can reattach a severed limb by holding it in place for one full turn. The heart of stone is also partially effective against type B attacks since it prevents bruising, swelling, and crushed blood vessels. Against bludgeoning weapons, the wizard only suffers half the normal damage. Cause wound spells always inflict minimum damage against a wizard protected by this spell. While the caster may not feel a sword in his rib cage, any damage sustained interrupts spellcasting. In addition to resisting injury, the heart of stone also renders the character immune to fatigue and exhaustion, whether normal or magical. He also gains a +4 bonus to saving throws vs. petrification attacks. While the heart of stone is quite powerful, it has limitations. First of all, determined physical attack can eventually destroy the wizard despite his unnatural resistance to injury—a mob of angry peasants with hatchets and spears can finish him off 1 point at a time if that’s what it takes. Second, the heart confers no protection against other attack forms, such as fire, electricity, cold, acid, and so on, although any bleeding caused by a burn is ignored. Disintegration effects also affect the caster. Most importantly, the caster loses the ability to naturally recover from injury and no longer regains lost hit points with the passage of time. Healing spells, potions and items are reduced to their minimum effect, so a cure serious wounds (2d8+1 hit points restored) would only return 3 hit points to a wizard protected by heart of stone. However, limited wish or wish can be used to restore 1 hit point per level of caster or all but 1d4 hit points, respectively. In addition to these disadvantages, heart of stone also renders the caster vulnerable in one other way: his own real heart can be destroyed, instantly slaying him. Naturally, the caster will want to take steps to hide and protect his true heart to prevent this from happening. The living heart continues to beat for the duration of the spell but requires no special receptacle or facilities to protect it—the caster could leave it lying on the floor, if he wished. The heart of stone cannot be dispelled, although a more powerful negation magic such as Mordenkainen’s disjunction can bring the spell to an end. Stone to flesh also undoes the magic of the heart of stone. No matter how the spell is ended, the wizard’s own living heart instantly returns to its proper place, and the stone heart appears wherever the living heart was kept. At this time, any injuries the wizard currently has are multiplied by 1d6 as the wounds begin to bleed again. For example, a necromancer who was injured for 6 points of damage instead suffers 6d6 when the spell ends. The material component for this spell is the stone heart itself. This must be a carved stone of quality (jade, obsidian, or gold-veined marble would be appropriate) worth not less than 5,000 gold pieces. It must be prepared by use of the enchant an item spell. The stone is not consumed at the spell’s end and may be used again if it is undamaged."

    "Description": "This spell transforms the caster’s body into living iron, which grants him several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster can only be injured by blunt weapons of +3 or better value, or monsters of 8+3 Hit Dice or more. Slashing weapons, falling, crushing, and constriction attacks of all types are completely unable to harm the caster, although an attack may knock him off-balance or pin him beneath tons of debris. Spells or attacks that affect the subject’s physiology or respiration—for example, poison, cloudkill, enfeeblement, contagion, or pain touch—fail completely, since the caster has no physiology or respiration while the spell is in effect. Also, spells that have weight limits should be applied to the wizard as if he weighed over 3,000 pounds. The wizard ignores electrical attacks and saves at +4 against fire attacks. If he saves, he takes quarter damage; if not, he takes half damage. If hit with a rod of smiting, he takes 2d8+6 points of damage unless the attacker rolls a natural 20. If this occurs, then the damage is doubled. In addition to the natural immunities of an iron body, the wizard enjoys powerful offensive abilities. His Strength score is raised to 20 (+3 to attack rolls, +8 damage) for the duration of the spell, and he can punch or bludgeon his enemies twice per round for 1d4 points of damage per blow, plus his Strength bonus. Unfortunately, his movement becomes slow and awkward, so he is reduced to a move of 3 and suffers a –2 penalty to his initiative rolls (or a reduction of his base phase by one step, in Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics). Most importantly, the wizard’s clumsiness and lack of breath prevent him from casting any spells while the iron body is in effect. Iron body may create additional hazards for the wizard as the DM deems appropriate. For example, rust monsters are extremely dangerous to a wizard using this spell. Heat metal spells inflict double damage to the caster. And, naturally, the wizard sinks like a stone in water—although he could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean—at least until the spell expired. Some magical items, such as potions or winded instruments, may be temporarily unusable as well. The material component for this spell is a small piece of iron that once belonged to an iron golem."

    "Description": "By means of the astral spell, a wizard can project his astral body into the Astral Plane, leaving his physical body and material possessions behind in the Prime Material Plane. Only magical items can be brought into the Astral Plane (although nonmagical items could be rendered temporarily magical through the use of some spells, if the DM allows). As the Astral Plane touches upon the first levels of all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can travel astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The caster then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body in the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell, but a second body cannot be formed in the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures in the Astral Plane. At all times, the astral body is connected to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially; however, normally only a psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed in a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the original body where it rests in the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astrally projected persons are able to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing in the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the wizard desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (such as a dispel magic spell or the destruction of the wizard's body in the Prime Material Plane).The wizard can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with him by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the wizard. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the wizard and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast, according to the wizard's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the wizard. (See the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set for further information on the Astral Plane.) Any magical items can go into the Astral Plane, but most become temporarily nonmagical therein, or in any planes removed from the Prime Material Plane. Armor and weapons of +3 or better might function in other planes, at the DM's option. Artifacts and relics function anywhere. Items drawing their power from a given plane are more powerful in that plane (for example, a ring of fire resistance in the Elemental Plane of Fire or a sword of life stealing in the Negative Energy plane)."

The crushing hand is under the mental control of the caster, and he can cause it to grasp and squeeze an opponent. No attack roll is necessary; the hand automatically grasps and inflicts constriction damage in any round in which the wizard concentrates. The damage inflicted depends on the number of rounds it acts upon the victim: 1st round 1d10 points 2nd & 3rd rounds 2d10 points 4th & beyond 4d10 points The crushing hand has an Armor class of 0, has as many hit points as its caster at full strength, and vanishes when destroyed. The hand is susceptible to normal combat attacks and damaging spells, but if it is struck by an area-effect spell, the person held suffers the same fate as the hand (i.e., if the hand fails its saving throw, the victim automatically fails his). The hand is not effective against noncorporeal or gaseous forms, but it does prevent creatures that are able to slip through small cracks from escaping. If the hand grasps an item or construction, the appropriate saving throw must be made as if squeezed by a Strength of 25. The material components of the spell are a glove of snake skin and the shell of an egg."

The caster must physically touch the item; if it is an opponent or something an opponent is using or wearing, the wizard must get into melee and make a successful attack roll. Any single metal item can be affected by the spell. Thus, a suit of armor worn by a creature can be changed to crystal, but the creature's shield would not be affected, and vice versa. All items gain a saving throw equal to their magical bonus value or protection (the DM has this information). A +1/+3 sword would get a 10% (average of the two pluses) chance to save; +5 magical armor has a 25% chance to be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% chance to save (for it is hit only by magical weapons of +3 or better quality). Artifacts and relics constructed of metal may be affected at the discretion of the DM, though it is highly unlikely. Affected items not immediately protected are shattered and permanently destroyed if struck by a normal blow from a metal tool or any weighty weapon, including a staff."

As soon as he touches (equal to a hit if melee is involved) any living creature, the victim loses two levels (as if struck by a spectre). A monster loses 2 Hit Dice permanently, both for hit points and attack ability. A character loses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities permanently (until regained through adventuring, if applicable). The material component of this spell is essence of spectre or vampire dust. Preparation requires mere moments; the material component is then cast forth, and, upon touching the victim, the wizard speaks the triggering word, causing the spell to take effect instantly. The spell remains effective for only a single round. Humans or humanoids brought below zero energy levels by this spell can be animated as juju zombies under the control of the caster. The caster always has a 5% (1 in 20) chance to be affected by the dust, losing one point of Constitution at the same time as the victim is drained. When the number of Constitution points lost equals the caster's original Constitution ability score, the caster dies and becomes a shade."

    "Description": "This spell grants the caster a powerful sixth sense in relation to himself or another. Although cast upon himself, the wizard can specify that he or another is the beneficiary of the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard receives instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the object of the spell. Thus, if he were the object of the spell, the wizard would be warned in advance if a thief were about to attempt to backstab him, or if a creature were about to leap out from an unexpected direction, or if an attacker were specifically targeting him with a spell or missile weapon. When the warnings are about him personally, the wizard cannot be surprised and always knows the direction from which any attack on him is made. In addition, the spell gives the wizard a general idea of what action he might take to best protect himself--duck, jump right, close his eyes, etc.--and gives him a defensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class. When another person is the object of the spell, the wizard receives warnings about that person. He must still communicate this to the other person to negate any surprise. Shouting a warning, yanking the person back, and even telepathically communicating through a crystal ball can all be accomplished before the trap is sprung, if the wizard does not hesitate. However, the object of the spell does not gain the defensive bonus to his Armor Class. The material component for this spell is a hummingbird's feather."

    "Description": "The casting of a gate spell has two effects. First, it causes an interdimensional connection between the plane of existence the wizard is on and the plane on which dwells a specific being of great power; thus, the being is able to merely step through the gate or portal from its plane to that of the caster. Second, the utterance of the spell attracts the attention of the sought-after dweller on the other plane. When casting the spell, the wizard must name the entity he desires to use the gate and come to the wizard's aid. There is a 100% certainty that something steps through the gate. Unless the DM has some facts prepared regarding the minions serving the being called forth by the gate spell, the being itself comes. If the matter is trifling, the being might leave, inflict an appropriate penalty on the wizard, or attack the wizard. If the matter is of middling importance, the being can take some positive action to set matters right, then demand appropriate repayment. If the matter is urgent, the being can act accordingly and ask whatever is its wont thereafter, if appropriate. The actions of the being that comes through depend on many factors, including the alignments of the wizard and the deity, the nature of his companions, andwho or what opposes or threatens the wizard. Such beings generally avoid direct conflict with their equals or betters. The being gated in will either return immediately (very unlikely) or remain to take action. Casting this spell ages the wizard five years."

    "Description": "When an imprisonment spell is cast and the victim is touched, the recipient is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the 9th-level wizard spell temporal stasis) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The victim remains there unless a reverse of the spell, with the creature's name and background, is cast. Magical search by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or similar means will not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned. The imprisonment spell functions only if the subject creature's name and background are known. The reverse spell, freedom, cast upon the spot at which a creature was entombed and sunk into the earth, causes it to reappear at that spot. If the caster does not perfectly intone the name and background of the creature to be freed, there is a 10% chance that 1 to 100 creatures will be freed from imprisonment at the same time. Note: The exact details of any creatures freed are up to the DM. A random method of determining this is to roll percentile dice twice (once for imprisoned creature density and once for a base number of creatures at maximum density). The rolls are multiplied and rounded to the nearest whole number. Each released creature has a 10% chance to be in the area of the spellcaster. If monsters are being generated randomly, roll 1d20 for level, with rolls of 9+ considered 9, and the exact monsters determined by the random encounter tables. For example, if the initial rolls were 22 and 60, the number of monsters released is .22 x .60 = .1320 = 13 monsters. Since only 10% of these will be in the immediate vicinity of the caster, the wizard may encounter only one or two of them."

Any creature in the straight-line path of these missiles receives the full effect,without benefit of a saving throw. The meteor missiles leave a fiery trail of sparks, and each bursts as a fireball. The large spheres (2-foot diameter) inflict 10d4 points of damage, bursting in a diamond or box pattern. Each has a 30-foot diameter area of effect, and each sphere is 20 feet apart along the sides of the pattern, creating overlapping areas of effect and exposing the center to all four blasts. The smaller spheres (1-foot diameter) each have a 15-foot diameter area of effect, and each inflicts 5d4 points of damage. They burst in a pattern of a box within a diamond or vice versa, with each of the outer sides 20 feet long. Note that the center has four areas of overlapping effect, and there are numerous peripheral areas that have two overlapping areas of effect. A saving throw for each area of effect will indicate whether full damage or half damage is sustained by creatures within each area, except as already stated with regard to the missiles impacting."

That is, spells being cast are separated into their individual components (usually spoiling the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and permanent and enchanted magical items must successfully save (vs. spell if actually cast on a creature, or vs. a dispel magic spell otherwise) or be turned into normal items. Even artifacts and relics are subject to Mordenkainen's disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster experience level of actually affecting such powerful items. Thus, all potions, scrolls, rings, rods, miscellaneous magical items, artifacts and relics, arms and armor, swords, and miscellaneous weapons within 30 feet of the spellcaster can possibly lose all their magical properties when the Mordenkainen's disjunction spell is cast. The caster also has a 1% chance per level of destroying an antimagic shell. If the shell survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined. Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and 95% likely to attract theattention of some powerful being who has an interest or connection with the device. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, the casting wizard must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities."

Only the spellcaster can pass in and out of the prismatic sphere without harm, though he can cast it over others to protect them. The sphere can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. Any creature passing through the barrier receives the effect of every color still remaining. The following table shows the colors and effects of the prismatic sphere, as well as what will negate each globe. Note that typically the upper hemisphere of the globe is visible, as the spellcaster is at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually hidden by the floor surface he is standing on.

    "Description": "With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of any living thing or creature below demigod status (greater or lesser deity, singular dragon type, or the like). The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has all of its abilities save those dependent upon Intelligence, innate magical abilities, and magic resistance, for the mind of the creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus, he can change into a griffon and fly away, then to an efreet and fly through a roaring flame, then to a titan to lift up a wagon, etc. These creatures have whatever hit points the wizard had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred. For example, a wizard is in combat and assumes the form of a will o' wisp. When this form is no longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away. When pursued, the golem-shape is changed to that of a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off and become a bush. If detected as the latter, the wizard can become a dragon, an ant, or just about anything he is familiar with. A wizard adopting another form also adopts its vulnerabilities. For example, a wizard who becomes a spectre is powerless in daylight, and is subject to being turned, controlled, or destroyed by opposing clerics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification. The material component is a jade circlet worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters at the end of the spell's duration. In the meantime, the circlet is left in the wake of the shape change, and premature shattering ends the spell immediately."

Once the item is enchanted, the wizard must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying are instantly transported to the abode of the wizard. No other creatures can be affected. The reversed application of the spell transports the wizard to the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the enchanted item, when it is broken and the command word spoken. The wizard will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor, but has no choice whether or not to go (making this a rare casting indeed!). The material components used include gemstones totaling not less than 5,000 gp value (whether they are faceted gems or not is immaterial). The components can be enchanted only once per month (usually on a night of a clear, full moon).

When this spell is cast, the wizard must be able to converse with the victims to bring the spell into being. During the casting, the wizard must call out to the creatures to be affected, informing one or all that their final fate, indeed their doom, is now upon them. The force of the magic is such that even if the creatures make their saving throws vs. spell, fear will paralyze them for a full round, and they will lose 1d4 Strength points from this fear (the lost Strength will return in one turn). Failure to save vs. spell causes the creature or creatures to face their nemeses, the opponents most feared and inimical to them. Actual combat must then take place, for no magical means of escape is possible. The foe fought is real for all intents and purposes; affected creatures that lose will die. If a creature's phantasmal nemesis from the weird spell is slain, the creature emerges with no damage, no loss of items seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of spells likewise seemingly expended. The creature also gains any experience for defeating the weird, if applicable. Although each round of combat seems normal, it takes only one-tenth of a round. During the course of the spell, the caster must concentrate fully upon maintaining it. If the combat goes beyond 10 rounds, those who saved against the spell can take action. If the caster is disturbed, the weird spell ends immediately. Creatures attacked while paralyzed with fear are free of the paralysis immediately."

Other forms of wishes, however, cause the spellcaster to weaken (-3 on Strength) and require 2d4 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space, and his body. Regardless of what is wished for, the exact terminology of the wish spell is likely to be carried out. Casting a wish spell ages the caster five years. Discretionary power of the DM is necessary in order to maintain game balance. For example, wishing another creature dead is grossly unfair; the DM might well advance the spellcaster to a future period in which the creature is no longer alive, effectively putting the wishing character out of the campaign."

Chain contingency allows the caster to designate either two or three spells that will take effect automatically under a specific set of conditions. In other words, when a set of conditions is met, the designated spells are \"cast\" immediately without the caster's intervention. Chain contingency must be cast together with the spells it is to trigger. The caster may choose either two spells to occur simultaneously or three spells to occur consecutively, one per round. Spells must be of 8th level or lower. Only the 6th-level contingency spell may not be included. The casting time of 2 turns includes the casting of the spells to be triggered. Unlike the contingency spell, spells \"stored\" in chain contingency can affect creatures other than the caster. These instructions must be carefully worded; the spell obeys the letter of its instructions and not the caster's intentions. In casting chain contingency, the wizard defines the conditions that will trigger the \"stored\" spells. This definition must be carefully worded, but may be as limiting or general as the caster desires. The caster also states the exact order, target, range, and manner in which the stored spells are to be cast. The spell has several limitations in triggering its spells. It does not have any powers of discernment; thus, an instruction to \"target the highest-level enemy\" is not possible. Furthermore, the conditions cannot involve a delay; a spell cannot be ordered to trigger \"three turns after I sneeze.\" When the named conditions are met, the chain contingency is automatically triggered. If all specifics of casting a spell are not specified (e.g., target or area of effect), the effect is automatically centered on the caster. Possible triggers might include a fall from a distance greater than the caster's height, the appearance of the first beholder within 30 feet of the caster, or the wizard pointing his finger and pronouncing a specified word. Only one chain contingency can be placed on the spellcaster at any one time. If a second is cast, the first chain contingency is cancelled. It is possible to have both a contingency and a chain contingency operating at the same time, provided that there is no overlap in the conditions specified for triggering the two spells. Spells triggered by the chain contingency have a casting time of 1. If the spell is triggered under conditions that are impossible to fulfill, it fails. If one of the spells in a series cannot be fulfilled, the remaining spells in the series are lost. Normal conditions, including line of sight to the target, must be fulfilled. All spells originate from the caster; thus, it is not possible for a caster to teleport and leave behind a series of fireballs to blast his enemies. In this case, the fireballs would either fail or destroy something at the caster's destination. The material components are (in addition to those of the companion spells) 500 gp worth of quicksilver; a gem of at least 1,000 gp value; an eyelash from an ogre mage, ki- rin, or similar spell-using creature; and an ivory statuette of the wizard (which is not destroyed in the casting of the spell) which must be carried by the spellcaster in order for the chain contingency to perform its function when triggered."

All buildings, people, and wildlife within the area of effect are also transported. The land forms a pocket of the Prime Material plane within the elemental plane. The pocket is a sphere with a diameter equal to the diameter of the land. The surface of the pocket allows creatures to enter or exit the pocket, but prevents the elements from entering the pocket. Inside the pocket, the land is surrounded by air of a temperature matching that of the Prime Material plane at the moment the land was moved. In addition, a source of water is created within the pocket. Before the spell is cast, the area to be moved must be surrounded by solid markers of material from the destination plane. Thus, if a wizard wants to move his castle to the Elemental Plane of Fire, he must first surround the area with solid blocks of matter from the Elemental Plane of Fire, such as hardened magma or magically-crystallized fire. The blocks must be spaced no more than five feet apart and may be placed above ground or under the surface (at a depth of no more than three feet). The wizard must be within the area to be moved when he casts the spell. When the land moves, a hemispherical crater is left behind in the Prime Material plane. Inside its pocket on the desired plane, the land continues its existence as if nothing changed, with the exception of occasional visits from planar creatures. Any land that is moved in this manner can never again be moved with this spell. The material component (in addition to the markers) is the appropriate magical device to control elementals of the desired plane (bowl commanding water elementals, brazier commanding fire elementals, censer controlling air elementals, or stone controlling earth elementals). The item must be permanently placed at the heart of the area of effect and cannot be used for any other purpose. If the device is disturbed in any way, the spell immediately fails, allowing the energies of the elemental plane to flood into the protected area."

    "Description": "his spell turns iron into silver or lead into gold at the caster's option. The prime ingredient for this spell is a magical item called the philosopher's stone, which must be touched by the wizard and alchemically combined with the metal during casting. The formula for mixing the stone and the metal must be known by the caster; this information is not provided by this spell and the spell is useless without it. (The exact ingredients and formula are decided by the Dungeon Master and must be discovered by the wizard in the course of adventuring.) Philosopher's stones vary in quality so much that each is capable of transmuting either 1d10x50 pounds of iron into an equal quantity of silver or 1d10x10 pounds of lead into the same amount of gold. It is not possible to know how much metal can be transmuted until the process is complete. If the caster has more iron or lead prepared than the spell is capable of changing, any excess is unchanged. The entire transmutation must be made at one time. Only one stone may be used per casting of the spell. The entire philosopher's stone is consumed in the process."

The spell is centered on the caster and follows his movements. The caster's own spells never cause wild surges when cast within the duration of a stabilize spell, nor do the effects of wild surges extend into the protected area. Furthermore, the wild mage's spells function at his true level; Table 2 is not used to determine level variation. The spell affects wildstrike, wildzone, and wildwind."

If there are more potential victims than the level of the caster, the DM must randomly determine which creatures are affected.

    "Description": "By means of this spell, the wild mage is able to channel raw magical energy through himself, shaping it into any form or effect he desires. The energy is similar in many ways to a wish spell, but has unique differences. Wildfire allows the caster to create the effect of any wizard spell of 8th level or lower. He need only have general knowledge of the spell and its effects; the spell does not need to be in his own spellbooks. Any normal saving throws vs. the spell effects are made at a -2 penalty. Wildfire can also be used in the creation of magical items. The energy created by the spell may be used to generate effects that are not created by known spells. Wildfire can also be used to create items out of nothing. The magical energy can be shaped and hardened to form solid objects. These objects have a greenish, glowing tinge and radiate magic. These objects are stronger than steel yet possess almost no weight. They are immune to fire, cold, electricity, and all forms of magical attack except dispel magic and wish spells. Even if they are subjected to these spells, a saving throw is allowed (equal to the creator's saving throw vs. spell). When creating objects, the caster is limited only by his own skill and the dimensions of the object. Items larger than a 10-foot-radius sphere cannot be fashioned. Creating the object requires only one round, regardless of size. Thus, a wizard could make an impenetrable dome or a small boat with this spell. Objects made of wildfire are neither stable nor permanent. Since the object is made of magic separated from the magical continuum, the material gradually deteriorates until the magical bonds become too weak to hold the wildfire in the chosen form. This decay takes 1d6+4 hours."

    "Description": "This spell is similar in effect to wildstrike and wildzone. When cast, a wall of faint, multi-colored lights springs into existence at the point indicated by the caster. These lights form a line 150 feet long. After the first round of the spell, the wizard can move the wall of lights. Each round, the caster can move the wall in the same direction or as much as 45 degrees to either side. Once the wall is set in motion, it cannot be stopped unless the spell is cancelled or dispelled. The lights can move 60 feet per round. The wildwind has two significant effects. First, all creatures struck by the magical lights suffer 2d6 points of damage. Second, any spellcaster struck while attempting to cast a spell automatically triggers a wild surge (use Table 2). Magical items that expend charges that touch the wall of lights automatically release one charge, also resulting in a wild surge."

    "Duration": "Special",
    "Description": "By covering a doorway with the most forbidden and lethal of necromantic runes, a wizard can protect a small portal so that any creature that tries to pass through the warded area without first speaking a word of command is immediately subjected to a modified death spell. A death ward may also be cast on an item (usually a spell book or phylactery) or on a tunnel or cave entrance no larger than 30' feet in diameter. A single application of this spell can kill up to twice as many hit dice or levels of creatures as the wizard who cast the spell has levels of experience (thus a 20th-level wizard can slay up to 40 levels with a single death ward). Each creature passing through the ward is entitled to a saving throw vs. death magic with a -4 penalty; if successful, the individual survives and the ward loses none of its lethality. However, those who fail their saves are immediately slain (as per a death spell) and their levels or hit dice are subtracted from the potency of the ward. Those with greater hit dice than the current power of the death ward are unaffected by the spell. For example, an I8th-level lich has cast the death ward (which can slay up to 36 levels) on the entrance to her inner sanctum. A party of four characters, each 15th level, enter her lair and foolishly traverse the warding. The first member fails his save and perishes, reducing the ward's effectiveness to 21 levels. The second character makes her save and thus escapes any ill effects (the ward remains unaffected, however). The third character fails the save and dies also, reducing the ward to 6 levels of potency. The fourth15th-level character has too many levels of experience to be affected by the weakened ward, which remains in effect until drained by a less powerful being. Despite its lethality, this is not a subtle warding. The protected area or object is literally covered with intricate, arcane runes and symbols at the time of casting These glyphs may flash ominously with pale red or blue light when approached within 10 feet. The entire area radiates a magical aura of lethal necromancy. Provided that he or she is on the same plane of existence, the caster will be immediately aware if the death ward has been triggered. By concentrating, the wizard who cast the ward may determine its current level of lethality, regardless of distance. This terrible spell is a closely held secret, guarded jealously by the most powerful and black-hearted of necromancers and liches. It was originally designed by liches, as they can easily sustain the rigors of casting such a spell. Mortal wizards who employ this powerful spell have a 25% chance of going insane (as per the contact other plane spell), contracting permanent paralysis (via a stroke), or suffering from a terminal illness (as per the cause disease spell) as adjudicated by the DM. The danger of misfortune is reduced by 5% for every point by which the mortal wizard's Intelligence is above 18, though this modified chance never drops below 5%. Curiously, the mental stability afforded by lichdom makes these undying wizards completely immune to the dangers of employing this ward. It is similarly rumored that certain ancient, evil dragons have developed an even more potent version of this spell, which they may employ in their lairs with impunity. The material component is a magical ink fabricated exclusively for this spell. The list of the ink's noxious ingredients is lengthy and complex, but it includes the venom of numerous poisonous animals and the acrid ichor of extraplanar fiends. Not surprisingly, the accumulation of these deadly components and the subsequent fabrication of the baneful ink itself sometimes results in tragedy for a mortal wizard, as mentioned previously. While the inscription process (the actual casting) of the death ward takes only 1 turn, the fabrication process of the ink (once the proper ingredients have been assembled) takes 1-4 days. The ink also requires the dust of powdered perdiots and garnets, worth between 2,000-8,000 gp."

    "Description": "This spell permanently switches the life forces of two creatures (one of which may be the caster). Both recipients must be within range at the time the spell is completed, or it fails automatically. When employed correctly, both creatures are surrounded by a radiant green aura and must save vs. spells at -6 to avoid the effects (obviously, willing recipients may forego the saving throw to consciously accept the effect). The spell only functions properly if both recipients fail their saving throws. If only one target of the spell fails the save, then the one who made the saving throw is automatically stunned (reeling and unable to take action) for 1 round. Meanwhile the other subject (the one who failed the save) is stunned for 1-4 rounds.In the event of a successful transfer, both life forces retain all of their original mental abilities and behavioral patterns, although their physical abilities are limited (or possibly enhanced) by their new forms. For instance, a decrepit necromancer uses this spell to exchange life forces with a hale, young warrior in the prime of his health. While the wizard gains a young and vigorous body (and all of the benefits that go with it), the unfortunate youth finds himself trapped in the withered shell of a dying, old man. Creatures unaccustomed to being shifted in this way are stunned for a minimum of 1 round after the transfer. The effects of this spell are permanent and can only be reversed by a full wish or by the reverse of the spell, revoke life force exchange. If one of the bodies is slain before reversal can take place, the life force currently inhabiting that body departs. That spirit and its new body are dead just as if the spirit was in the body that actually belonged to it in the first place. The life force originally belonging to the slain body is now irreversibly trapped in its new form. Short of expending two wishes (one to restore the slain body, and the second to transfer the life force), the only way to now restore the victim to his or her rightful body is by cloning the original body and casting revoke life force exchange."

    "Description": "This particular spell was the last and most powerful spell developed by the archmentalist Rheizom. It allows the wizard to selectively destroy, alter, or implant memories in the subject creature as he sees fit. He can completely reprogram a character, inventing a new persona, a new alignment, and assigning a new class as he sees fit. Only sentient beings can be affected; if the subject is not human, humanoid, or demihuman, he gains a +4 bonus on his saving throw. As described above, programmed amnesia can be used to achieve several different effects. The wizard may choose to make use of any or all of the effects listed below: A. Memory erasure. Any or all memories possessed by the subject can be erased at the caster’s will, including knowledge of specific events, people, or places. B. Memory implant. The caster can create false memories in the subject’s mind as he sees fit. Imaginary friends, events that didn’t really take place, betrayals by people the subject regards as his friends, or the friendship of an enemy could all be implanted in the subject’s mind. C. Skill erasure. The subject can be made to forget any or all class-based skills or proficiencies, including all or part of his THAC0 (it resets to 20), thief abilities, spellcasting, turning undead, or any other ability that stems from knowledge. About the only characteristics that can’t be affected by this usage of Rheizom’s programmed amnesia are hit points, saving throws, and ability scores. A character’s native language cannot be erased, either. D. Persona erasure. Combining the effects of a skill erasure and a memory erasure, this leaves the subject as a clean slate. Only his ability scores, hit points, saving throws, and native language remain. The character may assume any class or alignment available, beginning as a 1st-level character just as if he had decided to dual-class. (Even demihumans can dual-class in this fashion, since they forget all skills of their previous class.) E. Persona implant. By erasing the existing personality and implanting a false set of memories, the wizard can build a new persona for the mind-wiped character. In effect, he can decide what class, alignment, and personality the subject will assume after his persona erasure. If the new persona is an adventurer, the character dual-classes, as described above. F. Programmed erasure. The subject can be programmed to suffer a memory, skill, or persona erasure when a certain event takes place. For example, the wizard could set the subject to be wiped clean as a slate when the subject receives a coded message or arrives at some destination. Optionally, the wizard can decide to have an erasure partially or totally lifted when the programmed condition comes to pass. The casting time of this spell varies according to what effects the wizard wishes to impose on the subject. To cast just one of the listed effects, the wizard must spend two days secluded away from any distractions—a personal laboratory is a good example of a secluded place. In between the intense eight-hour casting sessions, the wizard can sleep and eat in the area he chose to seclude himself in. If the wizard breaks his seclusion for any reason, the spell is lost. Also, for every effect over the first, another day (with its eight-hour intense casting period) must be spent in seclusion. The wizard must be able to see the spell’s subject. At the end of each day of casting, the subject makes a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. Programmed amnesia is normally permanent, unless the wizard cares to specify a set of conditions or parameters that will end the effect (see F, above). Its effects can only be undone by a restoration or wish spell, or by successful use of the psionic science psychic surgery. A character who picks up new skills or class abilities while amnesiac must make a saving throw vs. spell when his own real memories return; if he fails, the skills he learned as an amnesiac are gone forever, replaced by his former abilities, but if he succeeds he retains any new skills, and may even choose to continue in his new class as a dual-classed character. Dungeon Masters should keep in mind that an amnesiac character should still meet the new class’s full prerequisites before he can become that class. Obviously, this is a very powerful spell, and the DM should very carefully examine a PC’s use of this magic. Dungeon Masters, take note—there are dozens of excellent plot vehicles hiding here if an NPC wizard uses this on a player character! Also, be aware that destroying a creature’s personality and replacing it with one more amenable to the wizard’s designs is never a good act."

    "CastingTime": "9",

    "Description": "This awful spell brings into existence a short-lived sphere of annihilation (as described in Appendix 3 of the DMG). The sphere is a black ball of nothingness about 2 feet in diameter that instantly and utterly destroys any matter that comes into contact with it. The sphere appears anywhere in the spell’s range and moves up to 15 feet per round as the wizard directs. If the wizard attempts to bring the sphere into contact with a living creature, the potential victim gains a saving throw vs. breath weapon to dodge aside, but a victim who is unaware of the sphere’s appearance or unable to move is destroyed without a saving throw. Once conjured, the sphere of ultimate destruction may not move exactly as the caster wishes. The wizard has a 75% chance to control it, plus 1% per point of Intelligence over 12 and 3% for each point over 15. In other words, a wizard with an Intelligence of 18 would gain a +12% bonus to his chance to control the sphere. If the wizard fails to control the sphere in any given round, it automatically moves directly towards him at its maximum speed of 15 feet per round. Unlike the magical item, another wizard may not contest the caster’s control of a sphere of ultimate destruction unless the second wizard possesses a talisman of the sphere. (See the DMG.) Should a gate spell be cast upon the sphere, there is a 50% chance that the sphere is destroyed, a 35% chance that nothing happens, and a 15% chance that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything in a 180-foot radius to another plane of existence. If the sphere is touched by a rod of cancellation, a tremendous explosion inflicts 3d4 x 10 points of damage to everything within 60 feet as the two forces negate each other. No other spell or magical item has any effect on a sphere of ultimate destruction. There is a 5% chance that any particular manifestation of this spell does not cause a victim’s utter destruction but instead transports him to a random plane of existence. The conjuring wizard has no way of knowing whether he has destroyed his enemy or merely blasted him into some remote dimension. The material component of this spell is a dark crystal ball that has been on the Ethereal Plane and that can be comfortably held in two hands. As noted in the previous chapter, several new spell characteristics appear in the spell descriptions of this book. These include casting subtlety, sensory signature, critical strikes, and knockdown. Refer to page 136 for more information about these new characteristics."
